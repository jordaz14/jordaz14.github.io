      <h2>Thank you Dear Mama</h2>
      <p>
        I think I've opened the past 3 blogs with an update regarding the status
        of my foot. And as the adage goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. So,
        we're opening with a 4th update.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the benefits of having a broken foot is that you get to see the
        generosity of people. In a city like New York, it's not often that
        people recognize each other's humanity. Understandably, it'd be an
        impossible feat to acknowledge every person that passes you on the
        street, but having a broken foot seems to bring attention to the fact
        that I may be in need of help every so often. Simply put, it's a visual
        cue that shows that acts of kindness would go a long way for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we'd all benefit from breaking our foot. It builds character.
      </p>
      <p>And... it allows me to get away with things.</p>
      <p>
        For example, yesterday I went to a cafe in my neighborhood for the first
        time since I had broken my foot. It's a bit far away, so I took a lyft,
        hobbled to the entrance, and someone was quick to hold the door open for
        me (very much appreciated). But when I entered, the cafe was slammed
        with people, and the only tables available were those that don't permit
        the use of laptops.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I knew full well that I was going to use one of those tables with my
        laptop, otherwise I'm calling a lyft straight back home. Soon after, the
        staff approached me to let me know my table was a "no laptop" zone, and
        that's when I knew it was time to play up the broken foot. So, I said,
        "oh sorry... is there anywhere else I could go? I would've normally left
        if there was no seating, but it's a bit harder for me to move around."
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose many consider this a valid request on my end, but also I
        didn't consider it entirely out of the picture that I just study at the
        student lounge across the street. It's an inconvenience, but one that I
        didn't mind undertaking if they were willing to die on a hill regarding
        their "no laptop rule". But I liked the vibes of the coffee shop, and I
        was going to milk the broken foot to let me stay in that coffee shop
        with my laptop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long story short, they made an exception, and the staff continued to
        boot people from the tables left and right of me that kept plopping out
        their laptop. Why was this satisfying?
      </p>
      <h2>Giovanni's Room by James Baldwin</h2>

        It was a gesture of great despair and I knew that she was giving
        herself, not to me, but to that lover who would never come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Giovanni's room tells the story of an American in Paris meeting the love
        of his life one fateful night at a bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        The premise of this book meets all my prerequisites for a book I'd
        typically enjoy: romance, paris, forbidden love. But, I'm not quite sure
        I enjoyed this version of those prerequisites. It's a bit hard to
        describe, but I think a book can excel at having 'quote-worthy'
        sections, but not feel fulfilling as an entire piece. So, before
        explaining any further, I'd like to share more of my favorite quotes:
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        As long as I was there the world could see and he could believe that he
        was out with me, his friend, he was not there out of desperation, he was
        not at the mercy of whatever adventurer chance, cruelty, or the laws of
        actual and emotional poverty might throw his way.
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        I loved her as much as ever and I still did not know how much that was.
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        It seemed to happen all at once - I suppose that only means it had been
        happening for a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, contrary to what the quotes may suggest, the story is about two gay
        men: one American & one French; the night they meet, they find
        themselves ending it in Giovanni's room. Being the Call Me By Your Name
        & Lie with Me supporter that I am, this book could not have failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it did, somewhat. The conflict of the novel is the protagonist's
        internalized homophobia. He's from the United States and not from
        sexually-progressive France; his father would not approve of his
        relationship with Giovanni; and his girlfriend is travelling Spain, soon
        to return back to Paris. The conflict is very apparent, but there's not
        much depth to the protagonist, and he's fairly unlikeable. He is meek &
        unfaithful, and cheats with women while sleeping with Giovanni to
        reassure if he'd be interested in his girlfriend when she returns.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know. The book also sways between the philosophical & romantic,
        but I think think this all would have worked better as a young-adult,
        contemporary romance. Obviously, that's a crazy thing to ask of a book
        written in the 1950s, but it felt like I was reading a mix of a book
        written by Albert Camus & Oscar Wilde - some things don't need a collab.

        In recent years. I reached a point in life when suddenly... It just
        happened. When... when... I began to worship what had been. And now I
        have nothing else. I have no future. I can only look back. And... It's
        not even nostalgia. It's... Fear of death. It's because I'm scared. It
        has nothing to do with art. I'm just trying to process.

      <p>Spoilers ahead.</p>
      <p>
        The target audience of this movie is lost 30 years olds, but I'd +/-
        that by about 6 years. If I had to list my favorite romance movies (in
        no particular order), it'd be:
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        La La Land <br />Before Sunset <br />
        Past Lives <br />
        The Worst Person in the World <br />
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the movies listed above, I also think this one best portrays
        realistic characters, or at the very least, characters which most
        resonated with me. Oftentimes, romance movies are flooded with
        idealistic lives and relationships, and that's why my favorites are
        those that break the cycle. I think the best stories of romance are
        those in which it's never fully realized. It paces the audience through
        an exhillirating beginning between the two protagonists, and later
        introduces a conflict that pulls them away, leaving the audience
        yearning for "what if".
      </p>
      <p>
        In The Worst Person in the World, the conflict is self-imposed by the
        protagonist Julie. Entering her 30s, she's struggled to make a career
        for herself as a writer, and feels like she's yet to find her place in
        life; this tension is heightened by her relationship to Aksel, an
        accomplished comic book writer who is 15 years her senior. In Aksel, she
        sees someone has found their purpose; who is ready to start a family;
        and, is ready to live life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Julie has yet to get there, and in what seems like a healthy, secure
        relationship, she feels stiffled. Attending Aksel's book signings and
        events leave her feeling like a spectator in her own life, so she calls
        the relationship off, willing to pursue a relationship with a man her
        age who's at a similar stage in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes the movie so interesting is that Julie's decisions seem to
        tow the line between self-sabotage & self-growth. It's a thin line to
        walk, and the movie's title demonstrates a self-awareness that not every
        decision Julie makes is admirable, and yet, it's incredibly relatable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the movie is centered around Julie, I truly think Aksel is one
        of the best characters I've seen in a romantic film. His character adds
        gravity to the decisions Julie makes because there's depth to his own
        feelings. For example, even when Julie is about to leave, Aksel asks
        her, "Are you really sure about this? Other people don't talk like us,
        Julie. It's so hard to find this".
      </p>
      <p>
        I think some may find Aksel's comment patronizing, but I view it as
        desperation. Aksel is in a different stage of life, he's gone through
        more relationships, and truly believed that Julie was the one who he'd
        build a family with. For Julie, it may be time to embark on a path of
        self-discovery, but for Aksel, he had found all he needed; that's not to
        say that Julie doesn't love him, she just didn't know if this is where
        her story is meant to end, and she recognizes a future in which they may
        be back together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love Aksel's character because of the vulnerability he displays in
        expressing his love for Julie. Several months later, Aksel is diagnosed
        with cancer, and Julie visits him in the hospital after discovering this
        news from Aksel's brother by random circumstance. In some of their last
        conversations, he tells Julie:
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        You were the most important relationship in my life. You don't have to
        say anything. I know it's not the same for you. That's normal. You have
        many years left to live. But I know, I feel it. And I want you to know.
        You were the love of my life. You're a damn good person. If I regret one
        thing, it's that I never managed to make you see how wonderful you are.
      </p>
      <p>...fucks me up.</p>
