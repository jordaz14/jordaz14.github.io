          People were always getting ready for tomorrow. I didn't believe in
          that. Tomorrow wasn't getting ready for them. It didn't even know they
          were there. <br /><br />-Cormac McCarthy

        Nothing is binary, but I typically think of books as belonging to two
        categories. There are those that broaden your worldview and others that
        resonate profoundly with you. I suppose there's a 3rd category for
        'garbo' books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad, The Defining Decade, and the
        fictional book my finance professor wrote several years back where he
        effectively characterized everyone in the book by their level of
        attractiveness...
      </p>
      <p>
        But for really good books, there's the two above. "Broadening your
        worldview" implies that the book discusses themes, experiences,
        information that you've largely been unfamiliar with, whereas
        "resonating profoundly" is as if every line the book has put to words
        the thoughts & feelings you've struggled to articulate. Simply, one
        ventures into the unknown and the other delves into the familiar. It's
        not impossible for a book to do both, but I think it's fairly uncommon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Educated by Tara Westover does both. And for that reason, I've struggled
        with how I'd like to talk about it. In a previous blog, I said I'm going
        to stray away from formal reviews since that type of content is abundant
        across the web (and ChatGPT could likely do a much better job than I
        could), and instead talk about how I relate to a book and the ways it
        makes me feel. But, it feels unfair for me to discuss how I relate to
        this book since Tara Westover's life also vastly differs from mine. At
        most, Tara and I both viewed a college education as a pivotal moment in
        which we left behind a part of ourselves in our hometowns. But at the
        same time, my father wasn't a manipulative schizophrenic who believe in
        the end of days, discouraged public school, and consistently put his
        childrens' lives in danger. It's during these sections of the book that
        I become soberingly aware of just how vast the human experience is, and
        decided I'd likely never visit Idaho.

        Well, this week's albums have been perfectly fine. There weren't any I
        felt inspired to write about, but I did listen to the album (i.e. 6 Feet
        Beneath the Moon by King Krule) of that really famous Tiktok song with
        peaceful guitar finger pickings: Out Getting Ribs.
      </p>
      <p>It reminds me of walking through UT's campus during sunset.</p>
      <p>I'd like to go back to school for a bit.</p>
      <p>
        At one point I thought about going into academia, but I'd like to teach
        more than I'd like to research.
      </p>
      <p>Surprisingly, things felt less urgent in college.</p>
      <p>
        Out Getting Ribs is nostalgic, and so is I'll Play You Out (Acoustic) by
        Route 500. That is all. Back to the present moment.

      <p>So I lost two of my toes.</p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I'm on big pharma's percocets (another shoutout to Bernardo), so
        can you trust anything I'm saying? Happy late April Fool's, I never
        actually broke my foot!
      </p>
      <p>
        But back to the story, I had surgery today (now, yesterday), and it was
        quite an experience. I've had surgery once before for appendicitis, so I
        now have a missing belly button and screws in my foot as random facts
        about me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My appendicitis was an experience in itself. I was in 5th grade, went to
        class, and had what felt like the most awful 'stomache' I had ever
        experienced. So, I went to the nurse, and soon after was at home for the
        next 3 days as my parents prescribed me Canada Dry Ginger Ale as a
        remedy for my upset stomach. On the morning of day 4 of my affliction (&
        once my dad was convinced this was actually a 'problem'), we went to the
        hospital and thus began my 3 day recovery process at the hospital. Mind
        you, the doctors advised that it'd typically take a week before being
        discharged, but my dad was particularly impassioned for me bounce back
        and not succumb to my affliction (i.e. well-needed rest?).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a memorable time. I remember when they lathered my small belly in
        cool gel and ran an ultrasound. I remember when they stuck an IV in my
        arm, and I started crying. I remember the metallic-tasting medicine they
        ran through my IV before an MRI scan. I remember them putting a mask
        over my face in the operating room, blinking, and waking up in the
        hospital room a couple hours later. I remember receiving "get well" soon
        cards from classmates, some apologizing for any grievances we've had as
        if I'd contracted a terminal illness. I remember being prescribed this
        milk-like medication which to this day remains the most vile things I've
        tasted. And that's about most of it. Note: this repetition wasn't
        intended for any stylistic effect, rather to just test my memory recall
        from 10+ years ago.... not bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for this time... I didn't cry with the IV in my arm or anesthetic
        being injected into my leg, but I was quite displeased about it. It was
        a bit comical though because after I told them I didn't really like
        "needles", they tried to ask me a bunch of random questions to distract
        me. I'm sure it helps for others, but it most definitely does not help
        me. After all, do we really want to create a cognitive association
        between me describing what I do for work and the pain of having a
        fucking needle shot up into my knee? Also, I've now undergone general
        anesthesia twice, and it's nothing at all like falling asleep. From the
        surgery room to the hospital room several hours later, it truly happens
        in the blink of an eye. In fact, I can't even remember what happened in
        the surgery room prior to them putting the mask on me. I remember being
        in there. They asked me questions. But for the life of me, I cannot
        remember the 10 minutes prior to going under. It's a bit off-putting,
        isn't it? To know you lived in a moment you can no longer remember?
