          People were always getting ready for tomorrow. I didn't believe in
          that. Tomorrow wasn't getting ready for them. It didn't even know they
          were there. <br /><br />-Cormac McCarthy

      <h2>To John Milton</h2>
      <p>There's another quote I'd like to share:</p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        There is only one paradise, and it was never lost or gained. You have
        Heaven in your hands all the time. It is not some other time, another
        place, a different condition. You have the whole of paradise with you
        now, total, complete, and paid for. You must only clarify your vision to
        see it. <br /><br />-Robert Johnson
      </p>
      <p>
        Believe it or not (& amidst the typos I'm too lazy to correct for),
        these blogs take a fair amount of time to type up. Oftentimes, I'm just
        staring at the screen, thinking about the order in which I'd like to
        articulate my thoughts. Even the opening quote took me around 15-20
        minutes to decide on, and all I had to do was copy somebody else's words
        from Goodreads. Is it a testament to the rigorous process of thinking or
        to my seemingly arbitrary moments of indecisiveness, or perhaps a mix of
        both? Given that I shared two quotes, most likely the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, what's the difference between "indecisive" and "thoughtful"? I
        think they're one in the same (at least for myself). After all, isn't
        just the context which defines which I am at that moment? For example, I
        think the order I chose for the quotes above was a thoughtful decision,
        but for the reader who is likely speeding through this blog and done in
        under ~10 minutes, it could be viewed as an an act of indecision. But as
        always, the reader is wrong, and I am right. Even though I can't
        perfectly articulate the difference, it was more important that y'all
        read the McCarthy quote first, then the Johnson quote.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a well-understood idea that we only ever live in the present
        moment. We can conceptualize the past and future, but our feelings of
        these things will only ever inspire us, hurt us, worry us, etc. in the
        present moment. Simply put, the "past" and "future" are concepts which
        evoke feelings. It's reductionist, and I suppose you could describe
        every idea ever that way, but I think these two ideas occupy much more
        mental headspace on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis. I like
        McCarthy's quote because it's his gothic way of saying "YOLO", except
        it's not necessarily a call to action either. Just a reminder. I think I
        often anticipate the next hour of my day, the rest of my day, and the
        rest of my week. And although there's a certain satisfaction I get from
        filling my calendar, it detracts from my ability to recognize that I
        will only ever exist now. So, I put the McCarthy quote first because I
        wanted to position and emphasize to the reader that we exist and occupy
        no other moment besides the present; he future isn't anything other than
        our decision to delay the present (typically for good reason).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes I don't feel like I delay the future for good reason (e.g.
        overthinking, hesitation, procrastination), and I wonder if I could
        benefit from being more spontaneous and indulgent. Is it my business
        school mindset? Am I subconsciously thinking about returns on
        investment, upfront costs, & compounding interest in facets of life
        outside of financial security? And if so, is that holding me back?
        Probably. There's an irony in expressing it this way, but perhaps it'd
        be best if I diversified my personality across different facets of life.
        Easygoing & collected at work, risk-seeking in life decisions,
        spontaneous in relationships, conservative in my finances? Would that
        feel disingenuous? Is there a base personality I should maintain? 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, that's why I like Johnson's quote. I found it in a book about
        mid-life crises (... I wanted to get ahead), and it questioning my
        preoccupation with the type of person I want to be professionally,
        romantically, socially. It's not bad to think about these things, but I
        think the inevitability of goalsetting is that it reminds you of what
        you don't have and are in pursuit of. It's necessary for personal
        development, but it also implies that perhaps there is something you
        could be better at... And so there's a fine balance, and the need for
        gentle reminders that you're doing well for yourself and life can be
        enjoyed now. Johnson's quote was that gentle reminder for me.

        Nothing is binary, but I typically think of books as belonging to two
        categories. There are those that broaden your worldview and others that
        resonate profoundly with you. I suppose there's a 3rd category for
        'garbo' books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad, The Defining Decade, and the
        fictional book my finance professor wrote several years back where he
        effectively characterized everyone in the book by their level of
        attractiveness...
      </p>
      <p>
        But for really good books, there's the two above. "Broadening your
        worldview" implies that the book discusses themes, experiences,
        information that you've largely been unfamiliar with, whereas
        "resonating profoundly" is as if every line the book has put to words
        the thoughts & feelings you've struggled to articulate. Simply, one
        ventures into the unknown and the other delves into the familiar. It's
        not impossible for a book to do both, but I think it's fairly uncommon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Educated by Tara Westover does both. And for that reason, I've struggled
        with how I'd like to talk about it. In a previous blog, I said I'm going
        to stray away from formal reviews since that type of content is abundant
        across the web (and ChatGPT could likely do a much better job than I
        could), and instead talk about how I relate to a book and the ways it
        makes me feel. But, it feels unfair for me to discuss how I relate to
        this book since Tara Westover's life also vastly differs from mine. At
        most, Tara and I both viewed a college education as a pivotal moment in
        which we left behind a part of ourselves in our hometowns. But at the
        same time, my father wasn't a manipulative schizophrenic who believe in
        the end of days, discouraged public school, and consistently put his
        childrens' lives in danger. It's during these sections of the book that
        I become soberingly aware of just how vast the human experience is, and
        decided I'd likely never visit Idaho.

        Well, this week's albums have been perfectly fine. There weren't any I
        felt inspired to write about, but I did listen to the album (i.e. 6 Feet
        Beneath the Moon by King Krule) of that really famous Tiktok song with
        peaceful guitar finger pickings: Out Getting Ribs.
      </p>
      <p>It reminds me of walking through UT's campus during sunset.</p>
      <p>I'd like to go back to school for a bit.</p>
      <p>
        At one point I thought about going into academia, but I'd like to teach
        more than I'd like to research.
      </p>
      <p>Surprisingly, things felt less urgent in college.</p>
      <p>
        Out Getting Ribs is nostalgic, and so is I'll Play You Out (Acoustic) by
        Route 500. That is all. Back to the present moment.

      <p>So I lost two of my toes.</p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I'm on big pharma's percocets (another shoutout to Bernardo), so
        can you trust anything I'm saying? Happy late April Fool's, I never
        actually broke my foot!
      </p>
      <p>
        But back to the story, I had surgery today (now, yesterday), and it was
        quite an experience. I've had surgery once before for appendicitis, so I
        now have a missing belly button and screws in my foot as random facts
        about me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My appendicitis was an experience in itself. I was in 5th grade, went to
        class, and had what felt like the most awful 'stomache' I had ever
        experienced. So, I went to the nurse, and soon after was at home for the
        next 3 days as my parents prescribed me Canada Dry Ginger Ale as a
        remedy for my upset stomach. On the morning of day 4 of my affliction (&
        once my dad was convinced this was actually a 'problem'), we went to the
        hospital and thus began my 3 day recovery process at the hospital. Mind
        you, the doctors advised that it'd typically take a week before being
        discharged, but my dad was particularly impassioned for me bounce back
        and not succumb to my affliction (i.e. well-needed rest?).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a memorable time. I remember when they lathered my small belly in
        cool gel and ran an ultrasound. I remember when they stuck an IV in my
        arm, and I started crying. I remember the metallic-tasting medicine they
        ran through my IV before an MRI scan. I remember them putting a mask
        over my face in the operating room, blinking, and waking up in the
        hospital room a couple hours later. I remember receiving "get well" soon
        cards from classmates, some apologizing for any grievances we've had as
        if I'd contracted a terminal illness. I remember being prescribed this
        milk-like medication which to this day remains the most vile things I've
        tasted. And that's about most of it. Note: this repetition wasn't
        intended for any stylistic effect, rather to just test my memory recall
        from 10+ years ago.... not bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for this time... I didn't cry with the IV in my arm or anesthetic
        being injected into my leg, but I was quite displeased about it. It was
        a bit comical though because after I told them I didn't really like
        "needles", they tried to ask me a bunch of random questions to distract
        me. I'm sure it helps for others, but it most definitely does not help
        me. After all, do we really want to create a cognitive association
        between me describing what I do for work and the pain of having a
        fucking needle shot up into my knee? Also, I've now undergone general
        anesthesia twice, and it's nothing at all like falling asleep. From the
        surgery room to the hospital room several hours later, it truly happens
        in the blink of an eye. In fact, I can't even remember what happened in
        the surgery room prior to them putting the mask on me. I remember being
        in there. They asked me questions. But for the life of me, I cannot
        remember the 10 minutes prior to going under. It's a bit off-putting,
        isn't it? To know you lived in a moment you can no longer remember?
