          We are not now that strength which in old days <br />
          Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are; <br />
          To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. <br />

      <h2>Hours Without Wi-Fi</h2>
      <p>
        For reasons beyond my understanding, Spectrum has left me without
        internet since 10am this morning. By the time you're reading this, you
        can largely assume that it was around the same time my WiFi was finally
        restored. With regards to work, I'm not complaining. With regards to
        being indoors with a broken foot, fuck. I can't even read the digital
        versions of my books.

        I've mentioned this before, but one of the most enjoyable things an
        author can do in a novel is depict the passage of time. Other mediums
        can attempt to capture this effect as well, but it's not quite the same.
        Perhaps that's why the Call Me by Your Name screenplay adaptation
        doesn't include the 20 year reunion between its protagonists near the
        end of novel. What makes reading most enjoyable is the time you commit
        to it. Unless you're reading at breakneck speed, finishing a book can
        typically take days, weeks, or even months. And if you're Sarah Teng,
        forever. This is also why I appreciate book recommendations. Unlike the
        occassional 5 second shitpost I may send to someone, my recommendation
        of a book implicitly conveys that the author's theme and my own thoughts
        are now interlaced, and in some way, it has made an impact on me.
