      <h2>Hours Without Wi-Fi</h2>
      <p>
        For reasons beyond my understanding, Spectrum has left me without
        internet since 10am this morning. By the time you're reading this, you
        can largely assume that it was around the same time my WiFi was finally
        restored. With regards to work, I'm not complaining. With regards to
        being indoors with a broken foot, fuck. I can't even read the digital
        versions of my books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from this hiccup, I feel fucking great. The past couple of days,
        my foot has felt normal. That's not to say I'm walking on it now
        (although I really really really feel like I could if I gave it a
        shot...), but the sensation and flexibility in my foot is coming back to
        me. It also, looks normal. Although things are not entirely normal yet,
        the semblance of something is sometimes all you need. No longer am I
        lugging around a swollen, red potato at the bottom of my left leg.
      </p>
      <p>
        What else is inspiring my newfound optimism? The weather. A friend once
        described that when they returned to the warm weather of Austin, they
        felt the physical manifestations of anxiety (e.g. stomach aches, acid
        reflux, exhaustion) dissipate from their body. Thankfully, NYC has been
        getting warmer, and last last Tuesday was incredible. For context, this
        was about 8 days post-operation, and I had yet to step outside since
        then. My brain deprived of fresh air, I stepped outside, crutched to a
        coffee shop, and ordered an iced hot chocolate. Genuinely, I can't
        recall the last time I had ever felt such a phyiscal high from the
        warmth of the sun on my skin. In that moment, I understood what it meant
        to be a Golden Retreiver boy.

        I've mentioned this before, but one of the most enjoyable things an
        author can do in a novel is depict the passage of time. Other mediums
        can attempt to capture this effect as well, but it's not quite the same.
        Perhaps that's why the Call Me by Your Name screenplay adaptation
        doesn't include the 20 year reunion between its protagonists near the
        end of novel. What makes reading most enjoyable is the time you commit
        to it. Unless you're reading at breakneck speed, finishing a book can
        typically take days, weeks, or even months. And if you're Sarah Teng,
        forever. This is also why I appreciate book recommendations. Unlike the
        occassional 5 second shitpost I may send to someone, my recommendation
        of a book implicitly conveys that the author's theme and my own thoughts
        are now interlaced, and in some way, it has made an impact on me.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's for the reason above that I enjoy multigenerational family saga
        books. Admittedly, I've only read two so far, as I'm sure it's not an
        endeavor many authors are willing to undertake and simultaneously
        perfect. After all, it took Min Jin Lee 28 years to write Pachinko, and
        John Steinbeck considers East of Eden his magnum opus (although he did
        write it in a year, but besides the point). Across the several hundred
        pages that family sagas typically entail, you've walked away with a
        bitesize portion of history once you finish. Nothing is comparable to
        the experience of life itself, but let's call this 2nd place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd be remiss if I didn't take the time to once again plug East of Eden
        by John Steinbeck. I'm realizing there's three camps (at least amongst
        my social circles): those who have read East of Eden and claim it's an
        amazing book, those who have read Pachinko and claim it's an amazing
        book, and those who will never touch either one of these books. For the
        3rd group, how's your 6 hours of daily screentime going? I, on the other
        hand, have undergone the effort to read each of these books. Like
        Odysseus, I have traversed far and wide to bring home an answer to my
        misguided children. The answer is, you'll like whichever one you read
        first the most. Take your pick, the multigenerational family saga of a
        Korean family in Japan during WWII and the years thereafter,
        highlighting the silent courage of one woman. Or, the multigenerational
        family saga of an American family during WWI, highlighting the bond
        between two brothers. Both are great. Both are biblical.

        If there's anything that Fred Again & Headache taught me, it's that I'm
        a sucker for songs which have a non-singing vocal track layered in the
        music. I think it's because I often struggle to understand lyrics in a
        song, so this makes it incredibly easy to figure out what's going on.
        Not every song is great, and some sound like typical electronic songs
        you might hear elsewhere, but that's to be expected of any album, I
        guess. However, the great songs are great, and some are borderline...
        epic. I don't think I've used that word to describe anything since
        middle school, but it's the best word my limited vocabularly could
        conjure in the moment.

        I'm thinking I should revise this section. Coming up with thoughts for
        both sporadic & organized noises has proven to be a difficult endeavor.
        I think this is why I wouldn't consider myself a music guy. But also,
        what sort of introspective and interesting commentary can anyone really
        make of electronic music?

        ...although I'm sure a particular group of desert people on drugs in
        Nevada would disagree with me.

      <p>This is my F1 moment.</p>
      <p>
        A couple years ago, a lot of people started getting into F1 (presumably
        from the Netflix documentary), and people often raved about it as a
        sport that was underrated by the masses. There's celebrity figures;
        There's storylines; It's an international sport; It's not just driving a
        car, it takes an insane amount of athleticism; It's more interesting
        once you get into it. I have not gotten into it yet...
      </p>

        But this is exactly how I feel about the UFC. On the surface, it's a
        brutish sport with two people hellbent on hurting each other. To which I
        say, that's partially true. However, what makes the UFC interesting is
        that it's both a sport and entertainment. Of course, sports are part of
        the entertainment industry, but what makes the UFC different is that
        there isn't a ranking system comparable to the NFL, NBA, MLB, etc...
        Ultimately, whoever is fighting for the championship is largely dictated
        by the head of the UFC (Dana White) and fan appeal. This can rub people
        the wrong way, but it also means that the storytelling component of
        fights is crucial. To speak in analogies, you're not going to have a
        boring superteam constantly two-peating, three-peating, four-peating for
        the championship in the UFC. It's not always about who is best. It's
        about country vs country. Bad guys vs. good guys. David vs. Goliath
        (i.e. these thematic ideas we often attribute to great moments in
        sports).
      </p>
      <p>
        Take, for example, one of the largest fights the UFC has ever had. Conor
        McGregor vs. Khabib Nurmagomedov. A fight which brought in $180M
        dollars. Conor McGregor, two-time champ, was notorious for shit talking
        and disrespecting his opponents, whereas Khabib Nurmagomedov, was the
        undefeated champ from Russia who treated every fighter with respect, and
        refused to play up the "entertainment" aspect of the sport. Leading up
        to the fight, Conor McGregor continued to barrage Khabib's nationality,
        religion, and family, calling Khabib's father "a quivering coward". Mind
        you, Khabib's father was his coach who he quit the sport for several
        fights later when he passed from Covid. In every way, they were polar
        opposites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast-forward to the fight... Khabib proceeds to destroy Conor McGregor.
        And at one point during the fight, as Khabib is on top of an exhausted
        Conor, Khabib says, "You want to talk? Let's talk now. C'mon. Talk.", as
        he proceeds to rain down punches. I don't know about you guys, but
        seeing a bully get humbled is highly satisfying and entertaining.
