        I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN
        FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING
        WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN
        FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING
        WALK.
      </p>
      <p>Sort of. My doctor cleared me to walk. But walking is hard.</p>
      <p>
        I'm talking as if my foot situation is now all over, but I'm still in my
        boot for the next few days as I continue to try putting weight on my
        foot. Regardless, having to use only one leg for the past two months was
        actually one of the worst experiences I've gone through in recent
        memory. If I had to choose between experiencing the pain I felt when
        first breaking my foot or the following 8 monotonous weeks, I'd happily
        break my foot again & again & again & again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to breaking my foot, I never wished for a broken bone, but I
        always had a curiosity about what it'd be like (and what bone I'd
        break). Retrospectively, this curiosity was misguided; regardless of
        what the quote above may suggest, there is no positive way to spin
        breaking your foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I will admit that there are probably way better bones to break
        and still live your life as normal - a broken foot is not one of them.
        Additionally, I'm a bit afraid of breaking bones going forward. Not
        because of the pain or the surgeries, but because of the amount of time
        in my life I'd lose out on; breaking my foot felt like a 2 month pause
        from my life, and it's still really frustrating to think about the time
        lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I'm still not very mobile. Honestly, I'm quicker on crutches
        right now. But, progress is being made - what a fucking relief.

        Ok, I would not recommend watching this movie, only because it is
        fucking tragic to watch unfold, but maybe that's on me for watching the
        movie late at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oslo, August 31st is the 2nd movie in Trier's Oslo Trilogy. The 1st
        being Reprised and the 3rd being The Worst Person in the World.
        Interestingly, all feature Anders Danielsen Lie as a lead role across
        the series' 18 years, uniquely capturing him and his characters at
        different points in their life. He doesn't play the same character
        across the series, but his age is often a talking point in each of the
        movies I've seen so far. Lastly, he's an incredible actor with no formal
        training, and his primary profession is as a doctor in Oslo in-between
        movies. Incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not trying to compare myself to an Academy-award nominated director,
        but if I was to make a movie, it'd be in the style of Joachim Trier -
        across the two movies I've seen, there's a a very raw portrayal of the
        human experience, depicting flawed protagonists undergoing existential
        problems in their urban lifestyles. Throw in a couple of literary quotes
        as well and that's essentially my style of movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        For context & spoilers, Oslo, August 31st captures the full day of a
        recovering drug addict, Anders, leaving rehab to visit his family and
        friends in Oslo. Throughout this day, you slowly watch Anders life fall
        apart as he struggles to come to terms with the life that awaits him
        outside of rehab, having spent the past 6 years using and dealing
        Heroin. My favorite scene from the movie is 'the cafe scene', where
        Anders sits in a cafe and hears the droning of conversations and life
        around him. I love this scene because it's the best depiction of
        loneliness that I've ever seen in media. I'd highly recommend watching
        this scene on YouTube.

        Alright April - what an eventul month. In the span of a month, I've
        gotten my foot cut open, taken percocet for the first time, shouted fuck
        a lot, fallen a couple of times, taken an insane amount of lyfts,
        average around 400 steps a week, & other misc. experiences.
