        Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what
        is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive.

        Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the
        blinder critics and philosophers of today, but the core of science
        fiction - its essence - has become crucial to our salvation, if we are
        to be saved at all.

        In recent years. I reached a point in life when suddenly... It just
        happened. When... when... I began to worship what had been. And now I
        have nothing else. I have no future. I can only look back. And... It's
        not even nostalgia. It's... Fear of death. It's because I'm scared. It
        has nothing to do with art. I'm just trying to process.

        Alright April - what an eventul month. In the span of a month, I've
        gotten my foot cut open, taken percocet for the first time, shouted fuck
        a lot, fallen a couple of times, taken an insane amount of lyfts,
        average around 400 steps a week, & other misc. experiences.
