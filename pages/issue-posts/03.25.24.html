          Stories are for joining the past to the future. Stories are for those
          late hours in the night when you can't remember how you got from where
          you were to where you are. Stories are for eternity, when memory is
          erased, when there is nothing to remember except the story.

      <h2>Break a leg!</h2>
      <p>
        2024 seems to be a defining year for many, and if March is any
        indication for the rest of my year, then I'm going to have a hell of
        year. If you have not yet received an unsolicited foot pic from me over
        the past week, then here's the news: I broke my foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        It sucks, and I'd prefer a world in which my foot wasn't broken. But
        also, I find solace in the idea that this was bound to happen (although
        my parents would vehemently disagree). Perhaps that's excusatory and too
        deterministic, but the same effort and approach I had taken the past 10
        months of climbing had left me largely unscathed, and nothing differed
        the day I broke my foot... aside from the fact that I went rock climbing
        during my lunch break, but I will never accept this experience as a
        lesson regarding the consequences of shirking from work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, it's interesting to reconcile an outcome I'd now consider
        "inevitable" with the the short-term outlook I had on these upcoming
        months prior to the accident. I had plans to travel, get back into
        running, climb more intentionally, etc, and each of these will take a
        momentary pause for the next couple of months. So, how can I reconcile
        an inevitability with an outlook that was entirely contradictory to
        it? Is that delusion? The miscalculation of risk? I don't know. Things
        don't need to make sense, I suppose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless, I now have to wait. For what? The future version of myself
        that I've envisioned. Whether that be the version of myself going back
        to Austin and feeling the warmth of 80 degree weather with a margarita
        in hand, ranchera music blasting, and the mist of water spraying from a
        fan overhead. Or, visiting Knoxville for the first time to see my friend
        who is recently married, meeting his wife, having a mild allergy attack
        from his cats, and sitting in their apartment with them on a late
        evening, watching their life happen in real-time and fathom how much our
        lives differ. Or, spending the week in a remote town of New Hampshire to
        go climbing after a day of work, appreciating how much slower life feels
        away from the city, and questioning if I'd live away from a large city
        for a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure two things are apparent now. One, I had a handful of trips
        I was jazzed about, and two, I tend to romanticize the future a lot...
        So, who is to say I can't romanticize the future of myself that involves
        crutches and a boot. Well, sure I can. So here's my attempt, albeit a
        somewhat reluctant one.
      </p>
      <p>
        There will be evenings where I'm reading a good book on my couch, warm
        lighting illuminating the pages as dusks sets and natural light
        dissipates from the room. Perhaps I'll watch a good movie after or keep
        watching the new tv series I've recently gotten into. Or, maybe delivery
        is on its way from my favorite sushi place. Or, there will be evenings
        where people come over and we're enjoying eating, cooking, drinking,
        talking, smoking, board gaming, video gaming, movie watching, music
        listening, or most other pleasant things that end with -ing. Or even
        better, there will be days where friends can help me take out my
        trash... please guys I have no way of taking out this trash right now,
        and it's starting to scare me.

        And thank you the baggie of dreadlocks I found in a drawer <br />while
        washing and folding the clothes of our murdered friend; <br />the photo
        in which his arm slung <br />around the sign to “the trail of silences”;
        thank you<br />the way before he died he held <br />his hands open to
        us; for coming back <br />in a waft of incense or in the shape of a boy
        <br />in another city looking <br />from between his mother’s legs,
        <br />or disappearing into the stacks after brushing by; <br />for
        moseying back in dreams where, <br />seeing us lost and scared <br />he
        put his hand on our shoulders <br />and pointed us to the temple across
        town;
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I didn't read a book this week, and I didn't read this poem this
        week either. But, it is a poem I have read, and I think it's quite
        topical given the events of this past week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside from its subject matter, I really like this poem because of the
        breadth of media it's available in. There's a YouTube video, audio
        recordings, and a version on Spotify with a backtrack from Bon Iver. My
        favorite is the YouTube video. It's 14 minutes long. It's worth it, and
        it's very accessible for those who don't like to read. If I could, I
        think I'd listen to it on a long subway ride, the ethereal backtrack and
        soothing vocal contrasting with the stress, noises, and rats of NYC's
        subway system.
      </p>
      <p>And if you don't plan on listening, here's the last stanza:</p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        Soon, it will be ove <br />rwhich is precisely what the child in my
        dream said, <br />
        holding my hand, pointing at the roiling sea and the sky <br />
        hurtling our way like so many buffalo, <br />
        who said it’s much worse than we think, <br />and sooner; to whom I said
        <br />
        no duh child in my dreams, what do you think <br />
        this singing and shuddering is, <br />
        what this screaming and reaching and dancing <br />
        and crying is, other than loving <br />
        what every second goes away? <br />
        Goodbye, I mean to say. <br />
        And thank you. Every day.

        No further comments, aside from the fact that Purify was one of those
        songs I had to keep replaying from the beginning because I kept thinking
        "damn, that's good" when hearing the opening riff.

      <p>So I lost two of my toes.</p>
      <p>
        Admittedly, I've been a bit melodramatic about the foot injury. After
        all, foot injuries are common; it'll only be a few months; I have a
        comfortable space with food & electronics; and, I have health insurance.
        This is less like the end of the world, and more akin to being a 10yr
        old kid stuck at home most of the time feeling incredibly bored (...and
        the boredom has already begun).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, emergency rooms do an incredible job of giving perspective to
        life's woes. When I walked into the emergency room, my own emergency
        felt like the end of the world. Perhaps selfish, but perhaps for the
        sake of my own self-preservation, my issue felt like a really big deal.
        But then I look around and realized that my big deal is comparatively, a
        quite little deal. I know it's important to not diminish your own
        struggles, but in that moment I was incredibly grateful that I was only
        there for a broken foot. Around me were the myriad of emergencies people
        were undergoing, and here I was with a funny story about rock climbing
        during my lunch break.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember the front desk woman asking what my purpose of visit was. She
        seemed drained of emotion, eyes darting across the screen. "I think
        I broke my foot", I told her. Her expression softened, she looked at my
        foot, and said "awww, I'm sorry". The change of expression stuck with
        me. I think it's because my situation was relatable, minor, and on the
        easier side of cases that likely come through. My broken foot was just a
        minor inconvenience, and it absolutely is. Her response was hilarious.
        It was also reassuring. I try to make jokes and laugh about shitty
        situations, so it was oddly comforting that the hospital staff thought
        it was funny too. Mind you, the resident making my splint said, "That's
        such a tech bro thing, to break your foot while rock climbing during
        work", unprompted. I enjoyed that I was providing comedic relief to
        myself, the environment, and the staff around me. My toxic trait was
        that I wanted to be the affable, 'easy-to-solve' patient. But maybe
        that's not necessarily a "toxic" thing to do. I think I just wanted to
        feel like my problem was not a problem at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, hospitals are testaments to the unfortunate volatility of
        the human experience. In 5 hours, I had seen and heard quite a handful
        of things which made me realize how inconsequential my own problem was.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember the man in front of me waiting to check-in. He could barely
        stand and was having trouble breathing. When the staff saw him and
        offered him a wheelchair, all he could said was "please". I learned he
        was peeing and coughing up blood, as he detailed these things to the
        lady at the front desk. By the time I wheelchaired past him in in the
        waiting room, his eyes were closed and he had an IV running through him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember the woman having an anxiety attack in her waiting room chair
        with her dog in her lap. She couldn't communicate to the hospital staff
        and they had no idea whether she was on drugs or not. Eventually, she
        calmed down, got up, and told them she's fine, thanking them for their
        help. She walked out.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember the doctor telling another patient that her husband's foot
        could not be operated on since the surgery took place at a Brooklyn
        hospital, and she'd need to take him there. She was stressed out, pissed
        off, and told the doctor "I'm on the verge of having a panic attack and
        we live here in Manhattan. How do you expect me to drag my husband all
        the way to East Brooklyn on the train just because the accident happened
        over there? Don't you all study the same stuff?". Honestly, she was
        right. She proceeded to shit on the doctor aloud, saying things like "So
        you're gonna charge him, but you can't help him"? I don't blame her.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember another woman sitting behind me while waiting to see a doctor
        the 3rd time. She was describing to the doctor her symptoms and how she
        couldn't make sense of it. Three times in the past couple of weeks,
        she'd feel hot, her legs would shake, and she'd collapse on the floor.
        She didn't know what was happening. The doctor asked of her family
        history, and she proceeded to detail her family members and their causes
        of her death. Abnormal heart conditions, old age, car accident. I
        remember her taking a phone call, calling a family member, and crying.
        She was scared to go outside because she didn't want to suddenly
        collapse on the street again.
      </p>
      <p>
        I remember sitting in my wheelchair, awaiting my radiology results. It
        was 7pm; I had no service; and I was alone with my thoughts. The male
        nurse crossed the room and approached the pair of socks visible to me
        from behind the curtains of the adjoining room. The socks were a bright,
        lively orange. I heard the nurse scan the patient's wristband and
        say, "oh, it's your birthday. Happy Birthday." I heard the voice of an
        older man respond, "huh?". There was a pause, and the nurse responded
        with, "let's get you going", wheeling away the orange socks.
      </p>
      <p>Things will be fine.</p>
