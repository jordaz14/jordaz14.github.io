          I thought poetry could change everything, could change history and
          could humanize, and I think that the illusion is very necessary to
          push poets to be involved and to believe, but now I think that poetry
          changes only the poet.

      <h2>Lemme know!</h2>
      <p>
        Understandably so, the time of day influences what I want to write (or
        type) about. I typically write in the evening after work, so I'm usually
        tired and contemplative. And if I'm not writing, at the very least I'm
        loosely outlining the things I want to talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
        So here I am on a Tuesday morning (lol, it's now Friday); the sun is
        out, I'm listening to J-rock, and work is fairly light. Easy breezy.
        Last night's outline is way more introspective than I need it to be now,
        so we're going to try to keep it light today (tonight).
      </p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>
        Well, this blog came out a bit later than I've anticipated, but this
        week has been pretty busy and fulfilling. I'm trying new things as of
        late, and it's fun to experiment in this game of life. Anyway, for the
        sake of brevity, I'm going to make this section a bulletin board with
        some call-to-actions:
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        If anyone's trying to go to Northern Africa, lemme know. <br />If
        anyone's trying to eat at Pollo Campero, lemme know. <br />If anyone's
        trying to start a company, lemme know. <br />If anyone's trying to get a
        book club going, lemme know. <br />If anyone's trying to go climbing,
        lemme know. <br />If anyone's trying to watch a UFC match, lemme know.
        <br />If anyone's trying to try something, lemme know.

        I'm going to do myself in right now. I used to listen to the Joe Rogan
        podcast a lot. This was pre-pandemic Joe where I feel like things were
        relatively more tame and he hadn't become a figurehead for anti-covid
        rhetoric and other conspiracies. He was and still is big on DMT though,
        and that's pretty cool. Point being, I've been listening to more Joe
        Rogan podcasts again, particularly the ones with comedians since those
        are the most fun and relatively harmless, so I listened to the one
        featuring Tom Segura. Quick aside, the episode with Aaron Rodgers is
        actually insane. That man is aggressively a conspiracy theorist who
        likes to "do his own research".
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, Tom Segura is comedian I've liked, and I was surprised by how
        relatively thoughtful/mild-mannered he seemed to other comedians I've
        heard on the show. And, I found out he wrote a book, so I had to read
        it. I've never read a book or writings from a comedian, so I thought
        it'd be entertaining, and it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not lifechanging. Not jaw-dropping. Not awe inspiring. But definitely
        entertaining, and honestly that's good enough when it comes to books in
        my opinion. I think I would've liked for the book to delve more into his
        upbringing, outlook on life, and particular approach/style to comedy
        (and there is a little bit of that), but it's more often about funny
        encounters he's had on airplane flights with celebrities. Also, some of
        the stories he wrote about are stories he has told for comedy specials
        and the sort, so if you're any bit familiar with any of his comedic
        work, then the book can feel a bit repetitious at times. Regardless, it
        was easy to read and something you could clear through in like 2-3 day
        if you just want to read funny stories about an up-and-coming comic who
        found his way into success, and all the wacky memories that accompany
        such a journey.

        You know how some songs close with audio recordings from the artist
        playing over the track? This album is like that. Except it's every song
        and all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I like it. It reminds me of a handful of electronic songs I enjoy
        that typically include some random audio sample of Alan Watt's saying
        some philosophical shit about us being the universe experiencing itself
        or whatever. Similar to UK drill, you either appreciate this type of
        music for the art form that it is, or you're just wrong and should
        reevaluate your taste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I like this album from a practical perspective as well. It's
        really easy to listen to. I struggle with listening to lyrics in most
        songs since it's difficult for me to discern the lyrics and their
        meaning from the melody, especially when they're so intertwined and it's
        easy to get lost in the rhythm and key changes (e.g. Pumped Up Kicks by
        Foster the People). But this album is different. It's not fair to say
        that lyrics are not the focus of other albums, but I do think this album
        presents a particular unique emphasis on the spoken word component to
        songwriting, and it's fun for me to engage that part of my brain when
        listening to this album.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in listening to some of the songs, I'd recommend
        the following:
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        Business Opportunities <br />The Beginning of The End
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I think this album is the creative project of an artist called
        Vegyn, and he did this really cool song with another artist I really
        like, Mk.gee:

      <p class="p-hlight">Debold - Mk.gee Remix V7</p>

        So, this blog came out a bit later than I would've liked, but I'm trying
        to be okay with letting life happen slower than I'd like it to. These
        past couple of months, I've been particularly antsy to meet arbitrary
        deadlines surrounding my studying, blogging, & reading, and I'm coming
        to realize that I need to enjoy the process more. I often think about
        how when people say they've achieved their goals, it's much more
        unsatisfying than they've anticipated. And that makes me nervous. I
        consider myself a hard worker, but without getting existential, what's
        the point of my hard work if I struggle to enjoy the present moment. I'm
        always thinking "what's next?", and I always feel like what's next has
        to be extraordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I'm trying to slow things down. I tried to optimize days, and now
        I'm optimizing weeks. 'Optimization' still seems like a flawed way to
        approach how one lives their life, but it's an improvement nonetheless,
        and progress happens SLOWLY, right? It hasn't been a particularly
        lifechanging experience thus far, but it has been a lot better. Thinking
        in the span of weeks has led me to feel less guilty if a day "flops",
        and I don't make the most of it like I would've liked; that used to give
        me serious stress, and now... less stress. Has it reached eustress? Not
        quite, but we're getting there.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's inspired this change? Well, I feel like I've realized the
        benefits of waiting some things out and being patient. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        I lost my work laptop on an American Airlines flight 2 months ago. They
        just emailed me last week that they found it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been growing out my hair, and I like how it's come along. Some days
        I was tempted to cut it and go back to my old hairstyle, but not
        anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've saved pretty aggressively since graduating college. Sure, I can't
        buy a house, but I can comfortably afford any trips, meals, & clothes
        that I'd like. That's something I shouldn't take for granted.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't care much for shopping, but I've realized how important it is to
        wear clothes you feel comfortable in, so I'm willing to dedicate time
        towards it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started climbing about 10 months ago, and it's nice to build a skill
        and bring my friends out to try a hobby that I enjoy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started coding a year ago. I went the past 4 years thinking it might
        be too hard for me, but I've challenged myself and discovered otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        And probably a variety of either things where I've realized that it's
        important to invest time, be patient, and let it pay off in due time.
        Speaking of being patient, if anyone wants to try Pollo Campero with me
        LEMME KNOW. I first saw them in Guatemala, but I never had the chance to
        try it then. Come to find out, this chicken chain is also in NYC. Does
        it compete with Cain's? Guatemalans might agree, so I'd like to find out
        myself.
