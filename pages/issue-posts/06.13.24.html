      <p>The Art of Loving by Erich Fromm</p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        The opposite pole of narcissim is objectivity; to see people and things
        as they are, and to be able to separate this objective picture from a
        picture which is formed by one's desires and fears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun book. It was the appropriate amount of digestible psychoanalytic
        content about loving.
      </p>
      <p>Do I remember much whenever I read anything like that? Not really.</p>
      <p>
        Still, I enjoyed it. It talked both about the "theory" of love and
        "applied" component of it. The theory of love spanned self-love,
        brotherly love, erotic love, and the love of faith. The application of
        love is about being disciplined & choosing to practice it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I initially thought the book might just discuss romantic love, but it
        didn't, and I was pleasantly surprised. I especially enjoyed its
        commentary with regard to faith. I'm not a particularly religious
        person, but I've always enjoyed the peace of sitting in a cathedral.
        And, I often wonder if I'd become more religious as I grow older. I've
        been sitting with the following quote from the book lately as I think
        through the above:
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        The idea that one could find the truth in thought let not only to dogma,
        but also to science. In scientific thought, the correct thought is all
        that matters, both from the aspect of intellectual honesty, as well as
        from the aspect of the application of scientific thought to practice -
        that is, to technique.

        Ok, I would not recommend watching this movie, only because it is
        fucking tragic to watch unfold, but maybe that's on me for watching this
        movie late at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oslo, August 31st is the 2nd movie in Trier's Oslo Trilogy. The 1st
        being Reprised and the 3rd being The Worst Person in the World.
        Interestingly, all feature Anders Danielsen Lie as a lead role across
        the series' 18 years, uniquely capturing him and his characters at
        different points in their life. He doesn't play the same character
        across the series, but his age is often a talking point in each of the
        movies I've seen so far. Lastly, he's an incredible actor with no formal
        training, and his primary profession is as a doctor in Oslo in-between
        movies. Incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not trying to compare myself to an Academy-award nominated director,
        but if I was to make a movie, it'd be in the style of Joachim Trier -
        across the two movies I've seen, there's a a very raw portrayal of the
        human experience, depicting flawed protagonists undergoing existential
        problems in their urban lifestyles. Throw in a couple of literary quotes
        into the dialogue as well and that's essentially my style of movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        For context & spoilers, Oslo, August 31st captures the full day of a
        recovering drug addict, Anders, leaving rehab to visit his family and
        friends in Oslo. Throughout this day, you slowly watch Anders life fall
        apart as he struggles to come to terms with the life that awaits him
        outside of rehab, having spent the past 6 years using and dealing
        Heroin. My favorite scene from the movie is 'the cafe scene', where
        Anders sits in a cafe and hears the droning of conversations and life
        around him. I love this scene because it's the best depiction of
        loneliness that I've ever seen in media.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd highly recommend watching the cafe scene on YouTube. I would not
        highly recommend watching the whole movie.

        Final note on my feet, but I think the photo above is so fascinating
        because not only am I standing up again, but you can literally see the
        muscular degeneration in my left thigh based on the wrinkling in my pant
        leg... crazy how you need to use your muscles to keep them.
      </p>

        Anyway, I've recognized lately that I'm not really getting my "writing
        fix" from blogs. Not that I don't enjoy typing up blogs, but they're
        much more journalistic & casual than any genuine attempts at creative
        writing. To some extent, these blogs are stylistically similar to if I
        sent someone a really long text message chain (i.e. I'm not really
        challening myself to write well). That's not to say that my blogs are
        shitposts, but I think my point is understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I've started writing a short story, and it's actually a really
        entertaining endeavor. I'm not oozing ideas every moment I sit down to
        write it, but I do find myself wanting to come back to it, similar to as
        if I were reading an entertaining book. We'll see what comes of it, but
        I went to a writing workshop a couple weeks ago, and it was really cool
        to talk about my story with others who are also interested in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'm on pace with Min Jin Lee's writing of Pachinko, my book should be
        out by the year 2054. See y'all then!
