          You must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more
          wholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory,
          especially a memory of childhood, of home. People talk to you a great
          deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved
          from childhood, is perhaps the best education. If a man carries many
          such memories with him into life, he is safe to end of his days, and
          if one has only one good memory left in one's heart, even that may
          sometime be the means of saving us.

        Up On Its Back And Away I Did Ride <br />Just As Fast As I Could From
        <br />The West Texas Town Of El Paso <br />Out To The Badlands Of New
        Mexico <br />Back In El Paso My Life Would Be Worthless
        <br />Everything's Gone; In Life Nothing Is Left <br />It's Been So Long
        Since I've Seen The Young Maiden <br />-Marty Robbins
      </p>
      <p>When I was younger, I really wanted to leave El Paso.</p>
      <p>
        I don't know what happened or what clicked, but at some point in my
        early childhood I told myself "I want to get out of here". It's not as
        if I had some awful childhood, I think I just had a really boring one.
        Some people look back on their childhoods fondly and have a sense of
        nostalgia for them, recalling family recipes, annual vacations, or
        holiday traditions. But I don't. Is that unfortunate? Well, I've
        normalized it... so I'd like to hope what's normal to me is not
        unfortunate for others.

        "Memory is won or lost on one criterion: Do you leave the formation of
        memories to happenstance, or do you decide to remember?" <br />
        -Gabrielle Zevin
      </p>
      <p>
        To which I say, what is there to remember of my childhood? Hamburger
        helper meals? Spending most days with my grandma after school who
        I couldn't speak Spanish with? Waiting years to convince my parents to
        let me play video games? Hearing "don't worry about it" when I often
        asked my brother what he was up to? My parents sending me off to hangout
        with the neighbor's kid who I really didn't fuck with? Being dragged to
        confirmation? Or Boy Scouts? All in all, I remember most days after
        school thinking, "I'm soooooooooooo bored." There was nothing
        particularly memorable, and therefore, not much that I can remember. I
        don't want to be melodramatic, but I do feel like life only started
        getting interesting once I started high school. From my own experience,
        high school came with much more autonomy and "firsts": the ability to
        drive, picking your electives, first relationships, leaving campus for
        lunch, high school bonfires in the desert, the prospect of applying to
        colleges and moving away, and band kid culture. Public education is just
        one big social experiment, and high school was the epitome of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I had a fun time. Prior to then, I was but a sentient little boy who
        was confined to school and home for most of his life. School was filled
        with schoolwork, and home was filled with gaming - that was about it. So
        at what point did it click that El Paso wasn't for me? Logically, it
        seems that high school was the eye opener, but I do think this
        transformation was much earlier. In fact, I remember when I was still in
        Elementary school, and my family and I went to some sort of event being
        hosted at UTEP. The President of the university was there, she came
        around to our table and asked me, "Will you be coming to UTEP?". To
        which I said, "No. Harvard." Thankfully, I didn't qualify If I was
        referring to undergrad or not. But point being, even as a child I was
        ready to leave El Paso. Perhaps high school solidified this decision; If
        life became so much more interesting with this much more autonomy, how
        much life was living itself away from me? It certainly couldn't be here
        in El Paso.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I went to UT. And wore "I'm from El Paso" like a badge of honor, and
        still do. I still stand by my hometown pride, it's not ironic. I suppose
        it's the type of relationship where only I'm allowed to hate on it. Why
        did I change my perspective on El Paso? Well, although I came from a
        fairly uneventful city like El Paso, it could've been much worse. After
        all, some people have to say they're from Dallas or Houston, and I
        wouldn't ever wish that on anyone.
      </p>
      <p>Now, I'm in NYC. So, what's next?</p>

        I judged a book by its cover, and I've learned my lesson. I'd known
        about this book for a couple months before finally reading it, and I
        held off because I thought it'd be gimmicky (especially with The Great
        Wave off Kanagawa as its title cover). But I was wrong. I'm a sucker for
        a romance and/or tragedy, and this book certainly covered its bases. One
        chapter into the book, I knew it was going to fuck me up. The best kind
        of book.
      </p>
      <p>
        When writing these "reviews", I've learned I don't care much to review
        them. Working as a critic across any creative medium seems really
        unappealing. But, I suppose I'm not quite sure if a critic is valued for
        their objective sense of an art's worth, or if they're valued for their
        distinct perspective and input. I.e. If you subscribe to a critic's
        review, is the art's worth now validated in your eyes, or do you value
        the critic's review independently of any worth you might assign to the
        art? Point being, I've tried to be semi-descriptive about the books I've
        read in past blog posts, sometimes describing setting, characters, or
        plot... but I'm going to stop doing that. That information is
        repetitious and can be googled, my thoughts and feelings can't... unless
        you specifically google this blog site.
      </p>
      <p>But... I will do it this one last time.</p>
      <p>
        Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow is a bildungsroman of three game
        developers, interlaced with their perspectives on life as told through
        gaming tropes.
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, my favorite part of the book is when Sam asks Sadie,</p>
      <p class="p-hlight">Why do you think we never got together?</p>
      <p>To which Sadie says,</p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        Sammy, we were together. How can you not know this? Lovers are...
        common. I loved working with you better than I liked the idea of making
        love to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always placed romantic relationships on a pedestal. To me, there
        couldn't possibly be a more profound and intimate relationship that two
        people could share with one another. After all (and if all goes well),
        there'll only be one person you share the rest of your life with.
        Friendships can be incredibly meaningful as well, but there's a level of
        familiarity and openness that comes with romantic relationships.
        Tomorrow, Tomorrow, Tomorrow challenged my perspective. I'm much more
        conflicted about how I value romantic relationships. Maybe it's not the
        most meaningful relationship someone can share with another. I've often
        thought about romantic partners as the person who completes you, but
        perhaps it's ok if that can be found elsewhere and in someone else. What
        I enjoyed about the book is that it wasn't suggesting that friendship is
        what trumps romance either, rather that there are relationships that are
        beyond friendship, romance, and family. I think the word I'm looking for
        is soulmate, and for some reason, I've always felt my soulmate needed to
        be my romantic partner as well. But if they aren't, then what does that
        leave my romantic partner to be in my life?

      <h2>Exodus by Bob Marley and The Wailers</h2>

      </div>
      <p>I saw the Bob Marley movie over a week ago. It was fun.</p>
      <p>
        It wasn't as a good as I was hoping it to be (although the 42% Rotten
        Tomatoes score should've prepared me), but it was fun to get excited
        about the movie and rally a group of people to come watch it. I enjoyed
        making an event of it more than the movie itself. Honestly, if the movie
        didn't keep making a really weird metaphor to Teddy Roosevelt on a horse
        in the middle of a field alit with flames, then it'd be a much better
        movie. Full disclosure, it was not actually Teddy Roosevelt, but it did
        feel like a less comical version of Robin William's Teddy Roosevelt in
        Night at the Museum. Quick aside, but Night at the Museum had a stacked
        cast: Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Owen Wilson, Rami Malek, Ricky
        Gervais, Bill Hader, Paul Rudd, Hugh Jackman, and Jonah Hill
        (allegedly). I haven't seen it in a while, but it occupies the same
        place in my mind as "Elf" with Will Ferrell - early 2000s comfort
        movies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to Bob Marley's album. We all know who he is. We all know how his
        music makes each of us feel (unless you're Jeffrey and just discovered
        him 4 months ago). However, I often never paid much attention to Bob
        Marley's lyrics, and the movie brought to my attention how often his
        reggae, easygoing tunes were packed with political commentary. Take my
        favorite song from the album, Jamming:
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        We're jammin' <br />To think that jammin' was a thing of the past;
        <br />We're jammin', <br />
        And I hope this jam is gonna last. <br />No bullet can stop us now, we
        neither beg nor we won't bow; <br />Neither can be bought nor sold.
        <br />
        We all defend the right; Jah - Jah children must unite: <br />
        Your life is worth much more than gold. <br />
        We're jammin'

      <p>I used to be a gamer.</p>
      <p>
        When I was younger, I often spent my free time playing video games.
        Little Big Planet, Skyrim, Fallout, Garry's Mod, Terraria, Minecraft -
        not an exhaustive list, but these games often composed the memories of
        my childhood. I played shooters like Call of Duty and Battlefield as
        well, but they were not healthy for me to play given my competitive
        nature. I remember my family telling me stories of how I'd stand up
        during a match and stare closely into the screen, intensely absorbed in
        wanting to win. Can you blame me? Shooters were a drug, and I'm sure
        game developers created them with that purpose in mind. 10 fast-paced
        minutes of rapid eye movement, finger twitching, and the satisfaction of
        coming at the top of the leaderboard. Sweet victory, to be rewarded with
        a new camo skin.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm smart, and I'm competitive. I wonder if these traits predate my
        interest in games, or if games enabled and encouraged them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding my competitiveness, most definitely the latter. I'm the
        youngest in my family (my brother and most cousins being 7+ years
        older), and I distinctly remember my brother & cousin consistently
        wrecking me in any competitive video game we played. There was no mercy,
        and I probably cried a handful of times. If I wanted to beat them, I had
        to truly beat them. You can imagine my satisfaction when I would wreck
        my brother in FIFA several years later and run up the score... talk
        about playing the long game. So, if you ever play a boardgame, card
        game, or video game with me, you'll probably notice that I like to take
        it easy and be easygoing about it, otherwise I'm going to run up my
        cortisol levels trying to win. It's better this way, otherwise you might
        find yourself losing to me in a game you've spent your entire childhood
        playing (sorry Nikhil). Perhaps that's why I identify as outwardly Type
        B and inwardly Type A.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the former, I'm not going to stroke my ego, but I think it's
        interesting that I'm as studious of a person as I am. I never felt
        pressured as a child by my parents to do well in school. In fact, I
        remember the first time I told my parents I was drinking in college
        while still underage, and they were worried that I had lost all drive in
        school and would go off the rails. It was a well-intentioned concern,
        but I remember feeling upset, and it was because I didn't like my
        ambition being doubted. I got defensive, and I remember saying something
        along the lines of, "You don't have to tell me to be ambitious and want
        a better life. I've always wanted it for myself." I suppose my
        competitive nature drove my studiousness, but I do like to learn things
        for the sake of knowing them as well. That's why I was interested in
        Philosophy, but then realized that a lot of people who make a profession
        of Philosophy are really obnoxious and self-righteous. It's the
        PURSUIT of wisdom! You're never going to find the answer, that's kind of
        the whole point. Anyway, how does gaming tie into this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I've realized that coding is the most interesting outlet for me
        when it comes to learning. It's the first time since playing open-world
        games like Minecraft & Terraria, where I could learn something (e.g. how
        to craft wood planks) and then create something 'real' (e.g. a two-story
        wooden house with a fireplace). After all, my username in Minecraft was
        The_Builder14, so there's likely always been this inclination for me to
        build 'things'. You can't do that in finance, accounting, consulting,
        [insert traditional business career path]. Maybe you make financial
        models in these career paths, but the impact isn't real. You're creating
        'perceived impact'. The quality of my work is likely evaluated by how
        much someone likes its assumptions. My gripe is that it's not
        quantifiable. Obviously you're making 'something' in most career paths,
        but what gives me satisfaction is if this 'something' can be objectively
        evaluated. The impact needs to be quantifiable. If you can't measure it,
        you can't manage it. I don't subscribe to this rigid framework in other
        facets of life, but if I'm committed to working 40 hours a week for the
        next 20 years of my life in exchange for a salary, then I need my impact
        to be measurable and compensated accordingly.
