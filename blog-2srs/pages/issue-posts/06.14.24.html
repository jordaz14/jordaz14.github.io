      <p>The Art of Loving by Erich Fromm</p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        The opposite pole of narcissim is objectivity; to see people and things
        as they are, and to be able to separate this objective picture from a
        picture which is formed by one's desires and fears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fun book. It was the appropriate amount of digestible psychoanalytic
        content about loving.
      </p>
      <p>Do I remember much whenever I read anything like that? Not really.</p>
      <p>
        Still, I enjoyed it. It talked both about the "theory" of love and
        "applied" component of it. The theory of love spanned self-love,
        brotherly love, erotic love, and the love of faith. The application of
        love is about being disciplined & choosing to practice it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I initially thought the book might just discuss romantic love, but it
        didn't, and I was pleasantly surprised. I especially enjoyed its
        commentary with regard to faith. I'm not a particularly religious
        person, but I've always enjoyed the peace of sitting in a cathedral.
        And, I often wonder if I'd become more religious as I grow older. I've
        been sitting with the following quote from the book lately as I think
        through the above:
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        The idea that one could find the truth in thought let not only to dogma,
        but also to science. In scientific thought, the correct thought is all
        that matters, both from the aspect of intellectual honesty, as well as
        from the aspect of the application of scientific thought to practice -
        that is, to technique.

        I went to Knoxville this past weekend to visit my old roommate - what a
        lovely place. It felt like how I'd imagine Austin 20+ years ago, and the
        University of Tennesse orange signage decorated across the city
        certainly contributed to that comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite memory from the trip was smoking with a bunch of 60 year old
        men on their porch on a hill overlooking their lake, with the smoky
        mountains set off in the distance. They were my favorite people ever and
        so easygoing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe because I was incredibly high, but I was engrossed in their
        conversations. Each of them were literaly storybook characters: Scar,
        Fry, and Mitch. Here are a few of my favorite observations about them:
      </p>
      <p>1. Their heavy southern drawl and use of "dadgum"</p>
      <p>2. "Fry, the guy who's always high"</p>
      <p>3. Boiled peanuts in a red solo cup</p>
      <p>4. A rottweiler named "scraps"</p>
      <p>
        5. Scar being the easygoing affable one, and Fry being the hardened
        veteran/prison warden
      </p>
      <p>
        6. Mitch chewing tobacco/nicotine-free dip because he has an oral
        fixation
      </p>
      <p>7. Them calling young patrol cops "uppity pretty boys".</p>
      <p>8. All of them usings ATVs as their method of transportation</p>
      <p>
        9. Fry not knowing where he bought a sink so he calls it the "sink-buyin
        store"
      </p>
      <p>
        10. Scar interjecting with a scratchy throat to say, "been there...
        didn't wannna do that."
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the photo above is my old roommmate's new house that he purchased.
        That's crazy.

      <h2>The Cat Whisperer</h2>

      <p>I'm a cat guy stuck in a dog guy's body.</p>
      <p>
        I used to be very allergic to cats. Not to where I'd die, but my throat
        would close up & I couldn't stop sneezing. So, an extremely unpleasant
        experience. But as of late, I haven't had allergic reactions to cat.
        That's character growth. Is it time for me to get a cat?
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, the cat above is called Luna, and during my trip to Knoxville
        this past weekend, Luna and I were homies. One of the greatest
        compliments you can receive is when you visit someone's apartment and
        they talk about how surprisingly well their pet is getting along with
        you. This was me and Luna.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Luna, I learned a lot of things about cats. Or at least, things
        about Luna. Here are some of them:
      </p>
      <p>1. They hate belly rubs.</p>
      <p>2. They love cheek scratches</p>
      <p>3. Their paws are so soft</p>
      <p>4. Not getting clawed when touching their paw felt like an honor</p>
      <p>5. Luna liked if you made the hand motion for money. She's greedy.</p>
      <p>
        If anyone has a pet cat to introduce me to. Hit me up. I have a way with
        cats apparently.
