            React state updates are asynchronous, thus prompting the need for
            useEffect(); whenever you call setState() in React, it places the
            update in a queue, thus any logic contingent on the update of state
            should be placed within a useEffect hook to update after render.

            A basic grasp of Regex syntax, including literal characters,
            metacharacters, quantifiers, grouping, and escaping to help with my
            pattern matching in my app to autocapitalize the first letter of
            every sentence. However, I think I'd need to run through some Regex
            exercises just to get more comfortable with the syntax. It reminds
            me of custom formatting in Excel.
          </li>
          <li>
            onKeyPress is deprecated, and I should stick to using onKeyDown - a
            small detail, but an important one nonetheless.

          Today I had my first pair programming, and it was a huge moment. Prior
          to today, I had been nervous about working with others on a project,
          as I was a bit worried that I might found out that I don't know
          anything about coding (especially since a majority of participants
          come from engineering backgrounds). However, the experience was really
          reassuring! I had often felt a pressure that I should know everything,
          and this experience reaffirmed that it's more about problem-solving
          than anything else when working on a specific implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a good portion of today, I was trying to implement a feature in my
          app where a user could hit two keys at the same time to create a new
          text block as they were typing, but it became a bit more involved as I
          gathered a better grasp on useEffect() while updating the state of my
          two key array to gather user input. I didn't finish the feature and
          instead implemented a row limit and autocapitalization feature to the
          textareas in my application to create a more seamless writing
          experience. However, I hope to revisit the keyboard input
          implementation as I have a better idea of how to store the inputs.
        </p>

          Tomorrow, I'd like to do more outreach with others, participate in the
          entrepeneurial ventures & browser engineering study groups, refactor
          my React project and add comments as well. Also, I'd like to branch
          out and watch a couple vides on UC San Diego's Data Structures &
          Algorithms courses.
