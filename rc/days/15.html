            Packing algorithms are methods used to arrange objects within a
            container in an efficient way, and are widely used in comptuer
            science for memory allocation. Types of packing algorithms include
            the first-fit, best-fit, worst-fit, and next-fit algorithms.

            A game loop is a continuous loop that runs throughout the life of a
            game, and it is responsible for updating the game state, rendering,
            and timing. requestAnimationFrame() is a browser API which is used
            to schedule a callback function that will be executed before the
            next repaint of the browser; the callback function also receives
            timestamp parameter which allows you the calculate the time elapsed
            between frames and update the animation state.

            Collision detection is the process of determining when two or more
            objects in a game interact with each other, and types of collision
            detection include Bounding Box Collision, Pixel-Perfect Collision,
            Spatial Partitioning, and Physical Simulation. getClientRect() is a
            method which provides information about the position and size of an
            HTML element relative to the viewport, and it can be used in
            Axis-Aligned Bounding Box collision detection to check if two
            rectangular areas are overlapping.

          Pair programming has been incredibly helpful because it's helped me to
          identify my strengths and weaknesses as a programmer. By working with
          others, I've learned I'm a really effective communicator with an
          incisive mind, but that I still

          Today, I created the movement-based component to our game by creating
          an element that takes user input and moves within the bounds of a
          confined space. Additionally, I created another element that moved
          across the screen and would alert the user that the game is over when
          the two elements collided.. Through this experience, I learned more
          about game loops and collision detection.

          Tomorrow, I'd to start stylizing the game environment to make it feel
          more like a game; the goal is to create the sense that a user is
          helping navigate a car on the highway and simultaneously dodging
          obstacles along the way.
