            indexof() vs findindex() are two JS array methods to locate elements
            within any array; however, the latter allows you to pass a callback
            function to execute on each value in the array, well suited for
            locating the index of a specific property within an array of
            objects. e.g. Arr.findIndex(x => x.property === value);

            "Lifting state up" and useContext are two ways in React to send data
            upwards from a child component into the parent component. 'Lifting
            state up' requires passing the updater function from the parent via
            props to the child, and updating the value within the child
            component... and useContext I'll need to dig into that syntax.

            Controlled input is a React concept in which form input data is
            handled by state and dynamically updated via the onChange event
            listener.

        </ul>

          After watching tutorials on the ChatGPT API, it also introduced me to
          using ChatGPT to ask questions about implementing its API, and I'm now
          realizing how incredibly helpful ChatGPT is when it comes to writing
          to code. That's not to say that I'm having it write code for me, but
          rather that it gives great use cases and provides detailed
          descriptions. It's also much easier than digging through Stack
          Overflow and Medium posts. I've never had much use for ChatGPT until
          now, and it's been amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from looking into the ChatGPT API, I also cleaned up some of my
          code and learned more about lifting state up in React. I currently
          have a dynamic list of elements in my app, but that was originally
          implemented through an array of numbers whose length determined the
          number of visible elements. I updated this to be an array of objects
          each containing an id and value property to pass into a component, and
          I'd like to pass up a value from each component into the parent
          component and update this value in its respective object in the array.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd like to touch up some minor issues in the code, add
          Framer animation to some of components, and begin implementing the
          ChatGPT API into my application. I'd also like to attend the teach-ins
          on C, Maths, and UX, so we'll see how those go!
