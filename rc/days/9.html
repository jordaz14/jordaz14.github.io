        <h2>Day 9 - More Talking, Less Coding</h2>
        <p>Today I learned...</p>
        <ul class="til-list">
          <li>
            Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is concerned with the design
            implementation of interactive computing systems for human use,
            covering topics such as usability, accessibility, psychology, and
            user-centered design principles. UI/UX differs slightly in that it
            is a subset of HCI, primarily concerned with the look, feel, and
            design of digital products/services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Framer Motion is a JS library for creating animations and
            interactive UI elements within React Applications, whereas Three.Js
            is JS library for creating 3D visualizations. Three.JS also exists
            at a lower level of abstraction, as you'll need a deeper level of
            understanding pertaining to 3D graphic concepts and rendering.
          </li>
          <li>
            Per State of JavaScript's research on JS libraries. It seems that
            most mature libraries see a rise in popularity and usage and
            eventually fall out of favor over time. Although this could easily
            be assumed for most things people use, it was fun to see it
            visualized.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          As suggestive of today's title, today was dedicated more to talking
          with others and less about coding. More specifically, I attended the
          'C Creatures' & 'Human-computer interaction' discussions; the former I
          was a bit lost on, whereas the latter I could better contribute.
          Although I wouldn't like to work in web design or UI/UX
          professionally, I find it so important to the success of frontend
          development. Even if you're offering the user a great feature, it
          means nothing if they don't find it appealing and easy-to-use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Admittedly, I did do a little bit of coding, but it was a relatively
          minor installation of the Framer library and implementation of onTap
          motion to my form buttons. Otherwise, I ideated a bit further as to
          what other frontend features I could incorporate into my project. A
          concern I currently have is that I don't believe my app will be
          suitable for mobile devices, so I'm contemplating creating a notice on
          mobile view that just says 'please see desktop version'. Is that bad
          practice? Otherwise, it'd require substantial thought to design a
          mobile view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow is 'The Impossible Stuff Day'. I'm not quite sure what it'll
          entail, and I'm a bit nervous about it, but I will participate! If
          you're not nervous, you're not growing.
