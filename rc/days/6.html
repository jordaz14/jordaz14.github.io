        <p>Today I learned...</p>

            The JavaScript map() method has takes three parameters map((element,
            index, array)); if you'd like to capture the index of an element via
            map without utilizing the mandatory element parameter in your code,
            you can insert '_' in its place to indicate that it's not being
            used.
          </li>
          <li>
            At a high level, dnd kit is a React library for building drag & drop
            interfaces. If you'd like to create a sortable drag & drop list,
            you'll need to: wrap your elements in both a DndContext &
            SortableContext, map through your existing list to output a
            SortableItem element, and create a handleDragEnd function to swap
            the index of two elements once a user finishes dragging an element.
          </li>
          <li>
            Object destructuring allows you to extract multiple properties from
            an object in a single statement and bind them to variables. Array
            destructuring is similar in that it allows you to unpact values from
            arrays without repeating the variable = arr[idx] syntax for each
            value.
          </li>
        </ul>

          I had a coffee chat with Winston Cooke today. My first encounter with
          an accountant turned software developer. It was a really refreshing
          conversation because: (1) We related on a lot of the excel
          inefficiencies that trouble a lot of Finance/Accounting teams from
          streamlining the workflows; (2) He also left his role in accounting to
          meaningfully upskill his coding ability for future opportunities; (3)
          He's from Texas.

          As for today, I created a sortable drag & drop list using the dnd-kit
          library. I had to watch a few tutorials to get a sense of how to
          implement it, and I'll likely need to read through the documentation
          at a later point since there's some animation glitches when you move
          two textareas of different heights over one another. Nonetheless, I'm
          happy ot have implemented another feature into my project!

          Tomorrow, I'd like to touch up the UI a little bit since it's a bit
          unexciting. I don't know if this is a popular opinion amongst
          developers who prioritize functionality, but I think UI goes a long
          way when creating a web app. For example, Pomofocus is a relatively
          simple 25 minute timer, but I love its simplicity and ease of use.
