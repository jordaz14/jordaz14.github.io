        <h2>Day 5 - TS & Array Headaches</h2>
        <p>Today I learned...</p>
        <ul class="til-list">
          <li>
            If you'd like to update an array in React, you should avoid any
            methods that mutate an array (e.g. push(), pop(), splice(), sort()),
            and instead create a copy of the existing array and then set the
            state to use that copy.
          </li>
          <li>
            There's some unexpected behavior of React's useState when using
            TypeScript. For example, if you pass an empty array as an argument
            into the useState() without specifying its type, it's going to set
            the type to be an array of never, thus being unable to later edit
            the state of the array.
          </li>
          <li>
            Quick fix, but I tried render an array of numbers inside my JSX
            element & discovered that I needed to convert the output to string
            since you can only render components or strings inside JSX.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There were a handful of coffee chats today, and all were great! It
          seems like a lot of people are working through ARENA, a curriculum
          designed for upskilling in ML engineering. Although ML engineering
          seems all the buzz and I have a background in statistics, I'm not
          quite sure if it's something I'd be interested in. Although I haven't
          invested time into it, so maybe I may prove myself wrong one day.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for today, I create a dynamic list of text areas in React, and I'm
          quite proud of the result. I was running into some hiccups with
          TypeScript errors & the state logic of React, but I incorporated the
          feature nonetheless. It's a bit interesting, but I'm learning to
          prioritize functionality over design first. I used to opt for the
          latter first, but I'm learning that functionality drives design.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd like to read further into the docs on the dnd-kit react
          library & hopefully incorporate some of that functionality into my
          project. Also, I'm investigating how to cache form data in React &
          avoid setting up a backend/db in the meanwhile. Admittedly, I'm a bit
          less familiar with how to do this, although I will figure it out in
          due time.
