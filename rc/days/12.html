            There are three ways to cache data in web applications:
            LocalStorage, Session Storage, and Cookies; LocalStorage typically
            holds around 5-10 MB per origin with data persisting after the
            browser is closed; SessionStorage is similar in storage capacity but
            only persists for as long as a page remains open; and, Cookies are
            typically limited to 4KB and used for session management.
          </li>

            Embeddings are representations of objects, such as words, sentences,
            or items, in a continuous vector space. Embeddings are used in
            machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to represent
            data in a way that captures semantic relationships and similarities
            between objects.

            Lazy initialization is the tactic of delaying the creation of an
            object or calculation of a value until the first time it is needed;
            this can be used in React's useState() such that you pass a function
            into useState instead of a direct value so that it will only be
            excuted once during the initial render to compute the initial value.
            The appropriate syntax would be: useState(() =>
            expensiveCalculation());

          Today involved a fair bit of socializing. The Recurse Center is a
          difficult balance between outputting code and socializing with others,
          and today I just the latter. I attended the 'Entreprenerds' call
          today, and it was refreshing to talk with others who also had a
          passion for using code as a means to deliver real-world impact to
          people. I originally got into coding less for the 'academic' reasons,
          and more for applied aspects of it.
        </p>

          In terms of coding, I implemented the block and character count
          trackers to my web app, and I also began researching what would be the
          best way to store any form data that the user may submit. I'd like to
          avoid implementing a backend/db because I don't find it necessary for
          the purpose of the application, especially since it'll be relatively
          small amount of data to cache via LocalStorage. Sometimes I feel like
          coding is just pushing structured data around from one place to the
          next.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to think more intentionally about other projects,
          teach-ins, and coursework I'm pursuing while at The Recurse Center.
          For example, there's a browser engineering group that I haven't been
          able to attend lately, but I'd really like to learn more about! Also,
          I'm looking into a DSA course offered by UCSD, so I should start a few
          intro courses to get a sense of the curriculum.
