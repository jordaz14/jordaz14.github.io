          Today begins my first day at The Recurse Center, and I'm reminded of
          the famous Socrates quote, 'I know that I know nothing'. Well, I know
          a little about writing scripts, extracting data using SQL, and
          building simple web apps, but I joined The Recurse Center because I
          wanted to become a much better programmer & work alongside others who
          are excited to do the same. Hopefully, I will finish the program
          knowing that I know something.
        </p>

          As for today, most of it was spent onboarding (i.e. joining
          introductory calls, familiarizing myself with the program's
          software/resources, and thinking more about how I'd like to
          meaningfully contribute to the program at-large). Aside from that, I
          built this 'blog' as a way to record my progress & share with others
          any updates along the way. So, welcome along to my journey!

          Tommorrow, I'd like to set up the development environment for my PERN
          creative writing project. I've often felt this to be the most daunting
          part of any programming project. I'm used to running simple lines of
          code locally on my computer, so figuring out how to structure my
          folders, install the right packages, and find an appropriate web
          hosting service are a lot of bases to cover. I remember a DevOps
          engineer at my old company once recommended I look into Oracle Cloud
          Infrastructure for hosting my first project... I'm grateful I
          discovered Render soon after.
