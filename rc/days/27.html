            An interpreter is a program designed in one language (e.g. Java, C,
            etc.) to execute code written in another language line by line; this
            differs from a compiler in that compilers typically translate the
            entire source code into machine code to create an executable.
            (although a compiler can simply be used for translating one language
            into any other).
          </li>
          <li>
            I've used 'this' before, but I got more clarity when solving a quick
            bug; I called the 'this' keyword in an object nested within another
            object, and I originally thought it would apply to the parent
            object, only to remember that 'this' refers directly to the context
            (i.e. object) in which it is called.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tokens, although used in LLMs, is also a term used in lexical
            analysis for interpreters; lexical analysis refers to the process of
            converting raw input text into a sequence of tokens, subsequently
            allowing for the analysis of the token sequence to build a data
            structure representing the grammatical structure of the program.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Before I embarked on any new projects, I thought it'd be good to
          finish the traffic trouble game I started a couple weeks ago. After
          finishing my chrome extension, I've learned that completing projects
          is very rewarding (after having done a handful of projects that never
          quite saw the light of day).
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the day, I both refactored some of the game code to be more
          object-oriented & added additional functionality to the game (e.g.
          moving + collision detector to every randomly spawned obstacle, score
          tracker, moving scenery, and keyboard arrow icons to indicate the
          correct input to the user). I hope to user these keyboard arrow icons
          for the mobile version, assuming I make this responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to incorporate difficulty levels to my traffic game, add
          a mute button, stylize the obstacles/scenery items a bit more, and
          refactor the 'start game' modal; I hope to finish the game by
          tomorrow, but we shall see. Additionally, I need to finish chapter
          four of 'crafting interpreters' ahead of the group meeting on
          Wednesday.
