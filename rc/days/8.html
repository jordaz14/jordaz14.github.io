            indexof() vs findindex() are two JS array methods to locate elements
            within any array; however, the latter allows you to pass a callback
            function to execute on each value in the array, well suited for
            locating the index of a specific property within an array of
            objects. e.g. Arr.findIndex(x => x.property === value);
          </li>

            "Lifting state up" and useContext are two ways in React to send data
            upwards from a child component into the parent component. 'Lifting
            state up' requires passing the updater function from the parent via
            props to the child, and updating the value within the child
            component... and useContext I'll need to dig into that syntax.

            Controlled input is a React concept in which form input data is
            handled by state and dynamically updated via the onChange event
            listener.

          I remember when I created my first website and spent most of my time
          figuring out the HTML/CSS required to put the page together. There was
          very little functionality, and I even used Tailwind instead of CSS so
          I could expedite the process a bit! Nowadays, I'm still using
          Tailwind... but only because I've done a lot practice with HTML/CSS
          and feel comfortable in my fundamentals. Although hard to quantify,
          I'm proud of how much quick I can fix design-related issues now that I
          have more experience.

          As for today, I touched up the UI of my project a lot. It's not a
          revolutionary design per se, but it certainly makes my project much
          more fun & appealing to interact with. I've touched on this in an
          earlier blog, but I'm learning to prioritize functionality over design
          first, as the former has implications for the latter. I used to map
          out fairly thorough designs in figma before starting a project, but
          this project is teaching me to prioritize functionality first and
          design around it.

          Tomorrow, I'd like to do more research into the ChatGPT API and see
          how/if I can incorporate it into my project. Ideally, I'd like there
          to be a prompt generator for my web app so users can have ideas when
          writing, but I'd need to restrict the subject matter and response
          length as well so a user couldn't 'abuse' this feature. Also, it's not
          free to use, so I'm sure I'll learn a bit about how pricing for APIs
          work.
