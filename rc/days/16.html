            There's an audio HTML element to embed audio (e.g. MP3s, WAV, etc.)
            into a web page, and it includes attributes such as src, controls,
            autoplay, loop, and muted. Although there is an autoplay attribute,
            some browsers required user input to toggle the audio track given
            their autoplay policies; this is done to prevent disruptive content
            from automatically playing without user consent.

            JS Modules are a way to organize code by dividing your code into
            separate files and functions, helping to manage dependencies and
            avoid global namespace pollution. Named exports allow you to export
            multiples values from a module using their exact names, whereas
            default exports allow you to export a single value with any name you
            choose. Additionally, an HTML script would need to specify
            type="module" to ensure that the browser processes JS files as
            modules.

            getBoundingClientRect(), offsetWidth/Height, and clientWidth/Height
            are all different ways to access an element's height and width
            information. However, they all differ ever so slightly.
            getBoundingClientRect() and offsetWidth/Height both include an
            element's border, whereas clientWidth/Height excludes borders.
            Additionally, getBoundingClientRect() takes CSS transformations into
            account, whereas the other two do not.

          We've made a game. I'm not quite sure it's a particularly thrilling
          game, but it's a game nonetheless. Well, technically we've made two
          separate games, and we'll need to combine them into one. I've made the
          part of the game that simulates movement in a car between rounds,
          whereas my partner made the part which displays the traffic signs for
          the user to select from.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I added styling to the game, including images for the car and
          obstacles, as well as correcting the design of the road and
          environment. Additionally, I added a start button to cue Willie
          Nelson's 'On the Road Again', as well as a Game Over sign should the
          user collide into one of the obstacles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, we'll have to merge our games together ahead of demo day. I
          imagine combining the logic will be a bit troublesome, especially
          considering that my game incorporates a game loop which we'll have to
          think about as we integrate the two games.
