        <p>Today I learned...</p>
        <ul class="til-list">
          <li>4 Layers of TCP/IP</li>
          <li>Build Systems & Make files</li>
          <li>Caddy servers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Before I embarked on any new projects, I thought it'd be good to
          finish the traffic trouble game I started a couple weeks ago. After
          finishing my chrome extension, I've learned that completing projects
          is very rewarding (after having done a handful of projects that never
          quite saw the light of day).
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the day, I both refactored some of the game code to be more
          object-oriented & added additional functionality to the game (e.g.
          moving + collision detector to every randomly spawned obstacle, score
          tracker, moving scenery, and keyboard arrow icons to indicate the
          correct input to the user). I hope to user these keyboard arrow icons
          for the mobile version, assuming I make this responsive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to incorporate difficulty levels to my traffic game, add
          a mute button, stylize the obstacles/scenery items a bit more, and
          refactor the 'start game' modal; I hope to finish the game by
          tomorrow, but we shall see. Additionally, I need to finish chapter
          four of 'crafting interpreters' ahead of the group meeting on
          Wednesday.
