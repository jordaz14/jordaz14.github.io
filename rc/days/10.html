        <h2>Day 10 - Three.js Sprint</h2>
        <p>Today I learned...</p>
        <ul class="til-list">
          <li>
            Three.js boilerplate code involves establishing a scene, camera,
            renderer, and animation loop. A scene is where you .add() all
            objects, light, and cameras; a camera establishes the FOV, aspect
            ratio, and positioning within a scene and its objects; the renderer
            uses WebGL to render 3D graphics and can be appended to the relevant
            element in the DOM to establish sizing; and, the animation loop is a
            function which refreshes the screen, assigns animations to objects,
            and renders via the .render(scene, camera) method.
          </li>
          <li>
            Within a scene, objects and 3D models both refer to elements that
            can be added to a scene; more specifically, objects refer to basic
            geometric shapes (e.g. cubes, spheres, and planes) that exist within
            the 3.js library and can be simply created by defining an object's
            geometry, its material (i.e texture), combining the two via: 'const
            shape = THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)', and adding to the scene via
            'scene.add(shape).'
          </li>
          <li>
            As for 3D models: (1) these are more intricate 3D objects typically
            rendered in an animation software like Blender; (2) they are very
            expensive to purchase for commerical use, but some can be found for
            free at Sketchfab; (3) Three.js recommends the glTF (GL Transmission
            Format) for 3D models, which can subsequently be loaded into a scene
            via the GLTFLoader(); (4) some adjustments may need to be made to
            the object's positioning, camera angle, and lighting to ensure that
            the 3D object is vsisible within the webpage.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Today was fun. Today was impossible (somewhat). Today was 'The
          Impossible Stuff Day', a day dedicated to pushing your programming
          limits and pursuing something you'd consider slightly out of reach of
          your abilities. I decided I wanted to learn Three.js and find a use
          case for implementation into future projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          For most of today I was scanning through Three.js documentation,
          tutorials, and online articles to get a better sense of how I could
          "get something off the ground". In the span of 6 hours, I went from
          two blue lines on a dark screen, to a rotating blue screen, to a
          Porsche on brick tiling, to creating a contact page with a 3D
          astronaut floating in the middle of space. It was rewarding to see how
          much I could accomplish in such a short amount of time, especially
          when some days progress seems to move slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd like to continue building out my React app. As it
          stands, I'm still not quite happy with the visual design, but for the
          time being I should prioritize incorporating other frontend
          functionality such as a paragraph/word count tracker, registering
          keyboard input via +/- keys, and a notification bar for other updates.
