        <h2>Day 20 - OAuth2 Flow</h2>
        <p>Today I learned...</p>
        <ul class="til-list">
          <li>
            OAuth2 is an authorization framework that allows apps to access user
            resources, and it consists of different authorization flows. Client
            credentials flow is used for when you don't need access to
            user-related info, and it felt fairly straightforward to implement
            relative to any other API I've worked with. However, I needed to
            refactor to an implicit authorization flow when realizing I needed
            the user's playback controls but did not have server side logic to
            implement the recommended authorization code flow.
          </li>

            chrome.action.onClicked is a event from the Chrome Extensions API
            which listens for a click when a user clicks the extension's icon.
            However, any Listeners add to this action will not work if you have
            a popup component to your extension; this is because the config file
            for the extension is specifying the default action of clicking the
            exension icon to instead open your popup html.

          Today was a productive day, and I'm quite proud of the progress I made
          in such a short period of time with my chrome extension. The goal is
          to build a chrome extension which queries the title of the active tab,
          uses the OpenAI API to provide a song request based off the tone of
          title, and feeds this request to one of Spotify's endpoints which
          would play a song within the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          I originally tried configuring my chrome extension for React, but
          decided soon after that I was likely over complicating the project by
          using React. Subsequently, I learned more about popup, background, and
          context scripts within the context of chrome extensions & used them to
          play an audio file that would run in the background even if the
          extension popup was closed. I also incorporated the ChatGPT API into
          my project and used it to provide a recommended song in the popup
          element pertaining to the mood of the page title.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to read through the Spotify API documentation to
          understand how I can use one of their endpoints to POST my song
          request provided by the OpenAI API and play it within my chrome
          extension. Admitteldy, I think the Spotify API integration may be the
          most difficult, so we will see how I progress tomorrow.
