            Syntactic and semantic layers refer to the different aspects of how
            code is structured/understood. The syntactic layer involves the
            syntax of a programming, defining how code should be written such
            that it can be parsed by a compiler or interpreter. The semantic
            layer involves the meaning/logic of the code, ensuring that the code
            behaves as expected and can catch loglcal mistakes & misused
            variables.

            A regular language is a type of language which can be defined by
            regular expressions and recognized by finite automata; to further
            elaborate, regular languages are simple enough such that regular
            expressions can describe the set of strings that make up the
            language. As for finite automata, I'm still trying to understand
            more.

            Similar to in programming, recursion in grammar is used to define
            rules that refer back to themselves. Left recusion happens when a
            rule refers to itself in a way that the recursive part comes first,
            whereas right recursion hasppens when the recursive part comes at
            the end of the rule.
