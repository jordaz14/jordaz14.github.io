        <p>Today I learned...</p>

          <li>Class vs Function Object Constructing</li>
          <li>Lisp programming language</li>

          Most notably, today involved a feelings check-in, and I deeply
          appreciated it. It's a bit surprising how fast 3 weeks has gone by,
          and at times I often feel like I haven't accomplished much. Perhaps
          it's not the best metric, but I tie accomplishments to projects, and I
          currently only have one that's still a WIP. In that way, have I
          accomplished much? Yes, I have. Progress is not linear, and it was
          reassuring to hear others feel the same way.

          In terms of coding, there was very little. I started an online course
          offered by UCSD in Data Structures & Algorithms, so I started watching
          a few of their videos and worked through a few problems. The course
          seems to cover unit testing as well, which I'm excited about since I'm
          unfamiliar with how to test my code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to refactor my code for my existing React writing app,
          start templating the code/structure for my Google extension, and
          continue working through the UCSD DSA course.
