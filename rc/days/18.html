            Regarding Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScipt, there are both
            class and function constructors to create objects. Function
            constructors use the function ConstructorName() {} syntax, whereas
            Class constructors use the class ClassName{} syntax. People seem to
            find the class constructor syntax more appealing, but I honestly
            find the function constructor more intuitive.

            Handling user keyboard input within a game loop requries using the
            keydown and keyup event listeners to update the 'active' state of a
            key within an object data structure outside of the game loop and
            subsequently checking the status of these keys within the game loop
            to inform the relevant function/action.
          </li>
          <li>
            .hasOwnProperty is a JS method to check for properties that exist
            directly on an object itself and not inherited from the prototype
            chain.
          </li>

          Today involved a lot of refactoring - it was interesting because
          although I was making improvements to the logical flow and readability
          of my code, there wasn't many changes to the user experience for the
          gamer. That felt a bit odd intitially, but it reminded me that coding
          is both about creating experience for users and other developers who
          would read your code.

          There were two big goals I sought to accomplish with this day of
          refactoring. (1) Improve the frame rate of the car when a user entered
          keyboard input by transitioning this logic into the gameloop & (2)
          change the obstacles to be dynamically generated and spawning at
          intervals from the top of the screen. I accomplished both, although
          there is much more work to be done with (2), given that I need to
          append these obstacles to a list and loop through this list with my
          movement function to make sure all obstacles that spawn are moving
          downwards.
        </p>

          I'm still a bit unsure as to whether I'll continue this project into
          next week, or if I should start another project I've been a bit
          excited about exploring regarding chrome extension. I would like to
          revisit this project and finish refactoring my code to be more
          object-oriented, but I might table this project for the time being.
