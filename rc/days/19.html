        <h2>Day 19 - Chrome Extension</h2>
        <p>Today I learned...</p>
        <ul class="til-list">
          <li>
            In the context of browser extensions (particularly Chrome), there
            are popup scripts, content, and background scripts. Popup scripts
            control the popup interface of the extension; content scripts allow
            interaction with the web page; and, background scripts run in the
            background even when the popup is not open, enabling control and
            communication of browser events between the popup and content
            scripts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Content injection refers to modifying content on a webpage by a
            script or extension; However, some sites block content injection
            (e.g. Google) due to security concerns. For example, I could inject
            elements and stylize the Recurse website via my extension, but I
            couldn't do the same for any Google pages. This was helpful to learn
            when I couldn't figure out why my extension was never working on
            Chrome's extensions web page.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are a handful of different ways to incorporate environment
            variables (i.e. server vs client side), and I'm typically used to
            incorporating them on the server side using the 'dotenv' package,
            but there was a neat workaround to use a Chrome Extensions API via
            chrome.runtime.getURL to fetch a JSON config file containing my
            environment variable.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Today was a productive day, and I'm quite proud of the progress I made
          in such a short period of time with my chrome extension. The goal is
          to build a chrome extension which queries the title of the active tab,
          uses the OpenAI API to provide a song request based off the tone of
          title, and feeds this request to one of Spotify's endpoints which
          would play a song within the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          I originally tried configuring my chrome extension for React, but
          decided soon after that I was likely over complicating the project by
          using React. Subsequently, I learned more about popup, background, and
          context scripts within the context of chrome extensions & used them to
          play an audio file that would run in the background even if the
          extension popup was closed. I also incorporated the ChatGPT API into
          my project and used it to provide a recommended song in the popup
          element pertaining to the mood of the page title.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to read through the Spotify API documentation to
          understand how I can use one of their endpoints to POST my song
          request provided by the OpenAI API and play it within my chrome
          extension. Admitteldy, I think the Spotify API integration may be the
          most difficult, so we will see how I progress tomorrow.
