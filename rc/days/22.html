            I've known about web development agencies for a while now, and I was
            particularly interested in joining one for my professional career,
            but I've learned more about the industry from another Recurser who's
            worked in it most of their life. They characterized it as a
            shrinking industry as social media has drawn users and interest away
            from the 'experiential' parts of web browsing.

            Fluid simulation is a computational technique, widely used in
            computer graphics, engineering, meteorology, and physics, to model
            the behavior of fluids in various environments, helping to explain
            phenomena likes waves and turbulence. Additionally, there are two
            main times of fluid simulation methods: Eulerian and Lagrangian.
            Eulerian methods are grid-based, computing fluid properties in each
            grid cell, whereas Lagrangian methods are particle-based and
            calculate the motion of particles.

            There's a web development program offered by Adobe which opens in
            October. I'd like to look into it more and see if I'd be a good fit.

          I demoed my chrome extension today! I was really proud of what I made,
          and it was really rewarding to see other people liked it as well when
          I presented it during demo presentations. It was a big moment for me
          as well because I finally felt like I could "hold my own" as a coder..
          That's not to say that I know everything, but rather that continuous
          learning is part of being a good coder.
        </p>

          Aside from adding some finishing touches to the style of my chrome
          extension, I tweaked with the OpenAI API a lot. I'm not sure I'd
          consider it prompt engineering, but changing the tone and structure of
          prompts had a huge change in the quality of its responses. For
          example, I noticed that asking ChatGPT to identify the mood of a topic
          and then recommend a song related to the mood was a bit superfluous &
          that it produced much better responses if I simply asked it to
          provides songs related to the topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to read the crafting interpreters books, revisit my game
          from last week, and refactor my chrome extension code to be cleaner.
