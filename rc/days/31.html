            Components of response time consist of latency, server processing
            time, data retrieval time, response construction time, and
            client-side rendering. Latency is the time it takes for data to
            travel between client and server; server processing refers to time
            it takes the server to process request; data retrieval is the time
            is takes to fetch data from storage systems; response construction
            is the time to serialize a response; and, client-side render refers
            to the time it takes to render the response data.

            A stateless API does not retain any information about the client's
            previous interactions with the server between requests, whereas a
            stateful API keeps track of previous requests and uses that
            information to influence the handling of future requests. Stateless
            APIs are associated with public APIs, Token-based auth, and CDNs;
            Stateful APis are associated with user log ins, shopping carts,
            collaborative applications, and real-time interaction.

            When working with Express.js, middleware refers to functions that
            have access to the request and response objects. For example, when a
            request is being made, it passes through a series of middleware
            functions before reaching the final route handler which sends the
            response. There are four types of middleware: application-level,
            router-level, built-in, and third-party.
