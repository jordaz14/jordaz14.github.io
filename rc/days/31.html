          I've really enjoyed making a browser game, and it's not something I
          expected to work on during my time at RC; However, working with game
          loops, object-oriented programming, and movement/positioning in
          javascript has been incredibly helpful for my own growth.
          Additionally, I feel much more comfortable using my IDE and have a
          much better grasp on extensions which can improve my workflow.
        </p>

          Today was the first day I've experienced a 'flow state' with coding,
          and it was incredible. I felt great to feel 'comfortable' while
          coding, and I was able to implement a lot of the core logic for the
          backend in my car browser game in a relatively short amount of time.
          At this point, I'd consider the game effectively done, but there's a
          few small details/bugs I'd still like to resolve ahead of Thursday's
          presentations.
        </p>

          Tomorrow, I'd like to investigate how to display web apps to the TV at
          the RC hub, add client & server-side validation for my leaderboard,
          host my backend code on Render, attempt to clean up some stray bugs
          when loading the initial game state, and meet the new batch of
          recursers coming in!
