            Folk computing refers to the everyday use of computing systems and
            technologies, outside of professional/academic settings, in which
            people make technology work for practical/specific needs. For
            example, creating scripts in Python or JavaScript can be considered
            a form of folk computing.

            The Lisp programming language, deriving its name from 'LISt
            Processing', is the oldest high-level programming language, and its
            fundamental data structure are lists; Lisp is uniquely known for
            homoiconicity, in which the primary representation of code and the
            data structures they manipulate are the same, which consequently
            supports metaprogramming, the technique of designing a program which
            can generate or transform other programs (even itself).

            JavaScript does not natively support cancellable promises, but there
            are custom methods to implement this ability. Uses cases for
            cancellable promises involve when a use may navigate from a page and
            the developer needs to a cancel a network request to limit resource
            use.

          Today was demo day, and unfortunately, we did not present. It was a
          bit discouraging, since it often feels like success needs to culminate
          in big moments like representations, but I'm still proud of the
          progress I made when it came to better understanding game development
          in the browser. For example, I'm much more comfortable with element
          positioning, collision detection, game loops, and user keyboard input.

          As for coding today, my partner and I experimented with different ways
          to merge our two games. Since they were effectively two distinct games
          with different logic and styling, we opted for simply redirecting the
          url when the two games needed to switch between each other. However,
          to solve for data persistency issues regarding key data (e.g. round &
          score tracking), we cached this data in sessionStorage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to refactor the game to be more object-oriented. As it
          stands, it's fairly imperative, and it's not a very scalable
          implementation of the game if the user would like to add different
          types of obstacles or incorporate other movement into the scene. I'm
          not quite sure I'll finish the refactoring tomorrow, but I'd like to
          have a new structure from which to build off of.
