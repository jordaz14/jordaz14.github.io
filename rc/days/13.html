            A Terminal User Interface (TUI) is a type of user interface that
            uses text and simple graphical elements, often including menus,
            forms, and navigational components that make it easier to interface
            with as compared to a traditional CLI; it differs from a GUI in that
            a TUI is less complex in terms of design, accessibility, and
            interaction. Vim & ranger are examples of TUIs.

            jq is a command-line tool that is designed to query, filter, and
            manipulate JSON data. curl is a command-line tool used to transfer
            data to or from a server and is widely used for interacting with web
            services and APIs. Combining curl with jq, a user can fetch data
            using an API and use jq to process it for reporting/scripting tasks.

            Dual Boot, Virtual Machines, and Docker are different ways of
            managing/running operating systems or environments on your computer.
            Dual booting involes installing multiple operating systems on the
            same physical machine, Virtual Machines is a emulation of a physical
            computer which runs its own operating system and applications, and
            Docker is a containerization platform that runs containers on the
            host operating system's kernel but provided isolated environments
            for applications.

          Most notably, today involved a feelings check-in, and I deeply
          appreciated it. It's a bit surprising how fast 3 weeks has gone by,
          and at times I often feel like I haven't accomplished much. Perhaps
          it's not the best metric, but I tie accomplishments to projects, and I
          currently only have one that's still a WIP. In that way, have I
          accomplished much? Yes, I have. Progress is not linear, and it was
          reassuring to hear others feel the same way.

          In terms of coding, there was very little. I started an online course
          offered by UCSD in Data Structures & Algorithms, so I started watching
          a few of their videos and worked through a few problems. The course
          seems to cover unit testing as well, which I'm excited about since I'm
          unfamiliar with how to test my code.

          Tomorrow, I'd to refactor my code for my existing React writing app,
          start templating the code/structure for my Google extension, and
          continue working through the UCSD DSA course.
