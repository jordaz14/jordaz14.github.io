            There are column-oriented and row-oriented databases; the former is
            especially useful for analytics teams writing queries on large
            datasets, whereas the latter is typically for smaller datasets
            primarily used for recording transactions.

            Both MacOS and Linux are based on Unix, an operating system
            developed in C by Ken Thompson at 'AT&T'; Windows Subsystem for
            Linux is way to have a Linux environment on a Windows PC without
            having to dual boot or run a separate virtual machine.

            Creative coding is a type of programming in which the goal is create
            something expressive, rather than functional; p5.js is a JavaScript
            library with a full set of drawing functionality.

          Today was the first day in person at the hub, and it's a fantastic
          space: two floors with dedicated spaces for conference calls, creative
          coding, hardware, 3d printing, pair programming. Notably, there's a
          lot of physical hardware around the space as well, and I've always
          been interested in embedded programming, so we'll see if I have time
          to explore that.

          Additionally, I experienced my first bug today during my time at RC. I
          set up my development environment yesterday on my desktop, hoping to
          simply clone the directory from GitHub to my laptop while at the
          Hub... only to realize that my 'npm run' command could not properly
          execute because it was installed on Windows and not in WSL. Long story
          short, a lot of time was spent trying to uninstall npm from the
          Windows terminal.

          Tomorrow (hopefully), I'd like to create the UI for my project in
          React. I've already created a design via figma, but I'm not quite sure
          if I'll stick with it once starting.
