            In React, props are a way to pass data from the parent component
            into the child component, whereas state is a way to manage data
            within the component itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are a handful of React libraries for drag and drop
            functionality. The two most notable are dnd-kit and
            react-beautiful-dnd; the latter is used by Atlassian yet is no
            longer maintained, while the former is still active.
          </li>
          <li>
            react-textarea-autosize is a great little library for automatically
            resizing textarea elements as the user inputs content - a specific
            use case, but helpful nonetheless.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Today was my first heads-down day during the program, and it felt good
          to stay focused for a long period of time. Additionally, I'm
          revisiting React, although I don't think I had such a great grasp the
          first time I used it, so I'm feeling a bit ambitious with the project
          I set out for myself. Regardless, it's about trusting the process and
          recognizing that progress doesn't happen in a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of today was spent incorporating some basic functionality into my
          React project, reformatting the UI a bit (my original design felt a
          bit clustered), looking into drag-and-drop libraries, and scheduling
          chats with other Recursers for tomorrow. It's amazing how quickly time
          passes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd like to watch a brief tutorial on React to ensure I'm
          grasping all the concepts as I continue building out my project. I
          always feel this pressure to know as much as I can when programming,
          but I've come to understand that it's much more about building context
          & problem-solving. Thus, a tutorial may be quite helpful for building
          context and ensuring that I'm asking the right questions when
          troubleshooting.
