            There are two module systems in JavaScript: CommonJS (CJS) &
            ECMAScript Modules (ESM). CJS was introduced for server-side
            JavaScript, and modules are loaded synchronously with the require()
            / .export syntax. ESM was introduced as part of the ES6 standard and
            is the official standard for JS modules in browsers & Node.js;
            modules are loaded asynchronously with the import {} / export
            syntax.
          </li>

            Bun is another JavaScript runtime environment which uses the
            JavaScriptCore engine, as opposed to Chrome's V8 engine, and was
            built to be faster and more efficient than Node.js. Additionally,
            Bun offers native support for TypeScript / JSX and is compatible
            with most NPM packages. However, Bun focuses on ESM and does not
            support CS modules natively.

          <li>
            A SQL injection attack is when an attacker can inject malicious SQL
            code into a query, allowing them to perform tasks such as bypassing
            authentication, retrieve data, and potentially delete or modify
            database contents. To avoid this, a developer should sanitize user
            input and ensure that the queries accept parameters for any
            placeholders, ensuring that any user input passed through is executed
            as data and not considered part of the SQL code.
