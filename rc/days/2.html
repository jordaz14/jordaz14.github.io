            You can split & rename terminals in VSCode to easily toggle between
            different directories... it's the little things.

            NPX differs from NPM in that it allows you to execute packages
            without installing globally. I'd like to see some use cases to get a
            better sense though.

            Vercel isn't only for hosting Next.JS projects, so it seems like the
            best service for my project. Although I'm still not quite sure why
            some recommend Heroku (backend) + Netlify (frontend).

          Today featured a pair programming workshop. Although I did not
          participate today (out of nerves, candidly), I recognize it'll be an
          important part of my growth. (1) For trying new things, & (2) better
          articulating my own code and working collaboratively with others.
        </p>

          I spent my time today thinking about goalsetting for the next three
          months, as well setting up the build environment for my project.
          Regarding the former, there are so many fun one-off events as part of
          the program, but which should I hone in on? Do I took a sudden
          interest in Game Dev, or should I get a refresher on C and its use
          cases? Decisions Decisions.

          Tomorrow is the first day in person, so I'd like to spend some time
          getting to meet everyone else and learn more about their interests and
          backgrounds. Teaching myself to code over the past year has largely
          been a solitary endeavor, and a big reason I applied to the Recurse
          Center was to find a community of programmers. Lastly, I'd like to
          start laying out the UI for my creating writing app.
