            tabindex is an attribute that allows developers to toggle whether an
            element is focusable via the Tab key when navigating a page.
            tabindex="-1" indicates that an element is not reachable via
            keyboard navigation; however, this presents accessibility concerns
            if the element has interactivity & the user is restricted to
            keyboard use only.

            I was wondering why my React app hosted through vercel would run
            into build errors while still working locally via the 'npm run dev'
            command, so I learned a little bit more about the difference between
            development and build environments, and how the former includes code
            refreshes and module replacements, whereas the latter minifies code
            for production.

            That there's something called Redux for state management in React. I
            read a couple articles, but candidly, I still have no idea what it
            does. I'll likely watch a tutorial just to get a sense of it, but I
            don't anticipate needing it for my project in the meanwhile.
          </li>

          I remember when I created my first website and spent most of my time
          figuring out the HTML/CSS required to put the page together. There was
          very little functionality, and I even used Tailwind instead of CSS so
          I could expedite the process a bit! Nowadays, I'm still using
          Tailwind... but only because I've done a lot practice with HTML/CSS
          and feel comfortable in my fundamentals. Although hard to quantify,
          I'm proud of how much quick I can fix design-related issues now that I
          have more experience.

          As for today, I touched up the UI of my project a lot. It's not a
          revolutionary design per se, but it certainly makes my project much
          more fun & appealing to interact with. I've touched on this in an
          earlier blog, but I'm learning to prioritize functionality over design
          first, as the former has implications for the latter. I used to map
          out fairly thorough designs in figma before starting a project, but
          this project is teaching me to prioritize functionality first and
          design around it.

          Tomorrow, I'd like to do more research into the ChatGPT API and see
          how/if I can incorporate it into my project. Ideally, I'd like there
          to be a prompt generator for my web app so users can have ideas when
          writing, but I'd need to restrict the subject matter and response
          length as well so a user couldn't 'abuse' this feature. Also, it's not
          free to use, so I'm sure I'll learn a bit about how pricing for APIs
          work.
