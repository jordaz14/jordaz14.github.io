        <h2>Day 21 - Flexing ChatGPT</h2>
        <p>Today I learned...</p>
        <ul class="til-list">
          <li>ChatGPT temperature</li>
          <li>ChatGPT tokens</li>
          <li>FastAPI, JSON Schema, Phind</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Today was a productive day, and I'm quite proud of the progress I made
          in such a short period of time with my chrome extension. The goal is
          to build a chrome extension which queries the title of the active tab,
          uses the OpenAI API to provide a song request based off the tone of
          title, and feeds this request to one of Spotify's endpoints which
          would play a song within the browser.
        </p>
        <p>
          I originally tried configuring my chrome extension for React, but
          decided soon after that I was likely over complicating the project by
          using React. Subsequently, I learned more about popup, background, and
          context scripts within the context of chrome extensions & used them to
          play an audio file that would run in the background even if the
          extension popup was closed. I also incorporated the ChatGPT API into
          my project and used it to provide a recommended song in the popup
          element pertaining to the mood of the page title.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd to read through the Spotify API documentation to
          understand how I can use one of their endpoints to POST my song
          request provided by the OpenAI API and play it within my chrome
          extension. Admitteldy, I think the Spotify API integration may be the
          most difficult, so we will see how I progress tomorrow.
