            In the context of large language models (LLMs), a token is a unit of
            text that the model considers the smallest unit of processing per
            the model's tokenizer. Each tokens has a specificed number of
            characters, and they are often used as the unit of billing for
            usage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Temperature is another concept used in LLMs which refers to a
            parameter which controls the randomness of a model's response,
            influencing how likely a model is to choose less probable words over
            more probable ones in its response. For example, a temperature of 0
            refers to a model picking the highest-probability token, whereas a
            temperature of 1 indicates the model picking much less coherent
            tokens.

            PUT vs POST are two HTTP methods to send data to a server. I've
            often used POST requests to send form data to a server, but I was
            less familiar with the use cases of a PUT request. It is best to
            decide whether to use a PUT or POST request based on the idempotence
            of the action. Thus, a PUT request will replace whatever is at a
            given URL and return the same response regardless of how many
            requests I make, whereas a POST request will create a resource or
            cause a change in the server that will return a different response
            each time. e.g. PUT x=10 vs POST x++;

          Although there is still work to be done, I've finished a demo of my
          chrome extension, and I'm quite proud of it. Although I've improved
          substantially as a programmer the past few weeks, I've yet to make
          anything I found substantive and useful, but that changed as of today.
        </p>

          Today, I read through the Spotify API docs to develop a better
          understanding of which endpoints I would need to use for my
          application, and thankfully, it was quite simple. Once I retreived a
          song recommendation response from the OpenAI API, I simply needed to
          fetch the Spotify URI of the song, identify the active device the user
          had spotify on, and submit the URI to relevant device to begin
          playback. Additionally, I added a form element for the user to filter
          song recommendations by genre or artist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, I'd like to stylize the chrome extension to look more
          visually appealing. Additionally, I plan to add another UI element
          which displays the current song which is playing in the user's spotify
          application. Given that the extension doesn't always recommend a song
          which actually exists, it'd be helpful for the user to get immediate
          feedback on what song is playing in their spotify app without having
          to toggle windows.
