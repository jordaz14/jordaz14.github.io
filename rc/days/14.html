            Lua is a programming language typically used in game development for
            scripting game logic; a game engine is software framework which
            handles rendering, physics, audio, scriptiong, and animation,
            helping developers avoid low-level programming details; and Love2D
            is an open-source framework written in C++ and uses Lua for game
            development.

            Python web scraping involves extracting data from websites by
            creating a script that can navigate web pages, parse HTML, and
            extract the relevant information. For example, my coding partner put
            together a script which scraped all images from a wikipedia page and
            stored them directly in our assets folder for a project.

            Branching strategies in Git are methods employed to help manage
            development workflows. Common branching strategies include the
            feature branch workflow, gitflow workflow, forking workflow, and
            trunk-based development.

          Today was the first day of the game jam kickoff. Using any language or
          platform, we were tasked with creating a game of our choosing, all
          while pairing with someone else to accomplish the task. I wanted to
          stay within the browser/javascript, and I partnered with someone else
          who was also interested in a making a browser game. We decided to
          create a game which involved traffic signs, inspired by the
          overwhelming amount of signs you might see while driving on the
          highway.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for what we accomplished, today we set up our repository, discussed
          the scope of our game, scraped the relevant assets from wikipedia, and
          set up basic functionality for the user. Essentially, a user will be
          prompted to select the right traffic sign from an increasingly hectic
          assortment of signs every round.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tomorrow, we'd like to incorporate more functionality into the game
          and see if there's an opportunity to incorporate motion between
          rounds. As it stands, the game is a fairly static experience, so it'd
          be nice to mimic a more traditional game with movement, obstacles, and
          scorekeeping.
