        I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN
        FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING
        WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN
        FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING WALK. I CAN FUCKING
        WALK.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sort of. My doctor cleared me to walk. But walking is still very hard.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I'm still in my boot for the next few days as I continue to try
        putting weight on my foot. Regardless, having to use only one leg for
        the past two months was actually one of the worst experiences I've gone
        through in recent memory. If I had to choose between experiencing the
        pain I felt when first breaking my foot or the following 8 monotonous
        weeks, I'd happily break my foot again & again & again & again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to breaking my foot, I never wished for a broken bone, but I
        always had a curiosity about what it'd be like (and what bone I'd
        break). Retrospectively, this curiosity was misguided; regardless of
        what the quote above may suggest, there is no positive way to spin
        breaking your foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I will admit that there are probably way better bones to break
        and still live your life as normal - a broken foot is not one of them.
        Additionally, I'm a bit afraid of breaking bones going forward. Not
        because of the pain or the surgeries, but because of the amount of time
        in my life I'd lose out on; breaking my foot felt like a 2 month pause
        from my life, and it's still really frustrating to think about the time
        lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I'm still not very mobile, and honestly, I'm still much quicker
        on crutches right now. Regardless, progress is being made - what a
        fucking relief.

        I didn't have a chance to read a full book as of late, so I've opted for
        a collection of short stories I read in the meanwhile. I'm going to
        spoil all of them - otherwise you could probably read through all of
        these in like an hour and a half. Here we go.

        The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas by Ursula Le Guin
      </p>

      <p class="p-hlight">
        Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what
        is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive.
      </p>
      <p>
        This story was fine. It's pretty revered in literature for some reason,
        but maybe that's because it takes inspiration from Dostoevsky? The whole
        story is about a city's happiness powered by the suffering of one child
        locked away underground. Is it justified? Is it inevitable? What is life
        like outside the city? Why leave the city? Is the comfort of some only
        guaranteed by the suffering of others? Isn't happiness all that matters?
        I'm assuming these are the questions your English teacher would ask you.
      </p>
      <p>
        My cacao teacher from Guatemala would argue "yes, happiness is all that
        matters." And utilitarians would add, "yes, the suffering is justified
        in favor of the majority." Boom, problem solved.

        There Will Come Soft Rains by Ray Bradbury
      </p>
      <p class="p-hlight">
        Time had become surreal in the absence of human presence, slowing down
        and stretching into eternity.
      </p>
      <p>
        After Fashrenheit 451, this is the 2nd thing I've read by Ray Bradbury -
        I like his work. For some reason, Ray Bradbury occupies the same space
        in my head as George Orwell, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller. Maybe they
        all took inspiration from each others?
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, for a story seemingly devoid of any real plot, I'm surprised I
        enjoyed this one as much as I did. The whole story just details a smart
        house in 2026, years after a nuclear explosion. No one's survived, and
        there's no other houses still standing. It's just this house, and it
        continues to perform its automated tasks long after anyone is around.
        It's very ominous and places the reader in a time and space where they
        no longer matter. I think most post-apocalpytic stories still feature
        humans in some capacity, so it was really interesting to read a story
        devoid of people.

      <p class="p-hlight">
        Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the
        blinder critics and philosophers of today, but the core of science
        fiction - its essence - has become crucial to our salvation, if we are
        to be saved at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This story is about 10 pages of really boring build just to climax in
        the very last sentence. Stories are an investment of time, I get it, but
        this easily could've been shortened to 3 paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not going to try understand the science/theory as I explain it, but
        pretty much humans build a superintelligent computer that advances until
        the end of time. Everyone keeps asking it how to prevent the end of the
        universe, and it is only until the very literal end of time (devoid of
        humans), that it has the answer. It's answer is, "LET THERE BE LIGHT".
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the idea though. We created God, and God created us? We created
        ourselves? The universe is cylical? Fun thoughts.

        A Good Man is Hard to Find by Flannery O'Connor

        "If you would pray," the old lady said, "Jesus would help you." <br />
        "That's right," The Misfit Said. <br />
        "Well then, why don't you pray?" she asked trembling with delight
        suddenly. <br />
        "I don't want no help", he said. "I'm doing all right by myself."
      </p>
      <p>
        This story is continued proof that the Southern Gothic genre is cool af.
        Tldr: protagonist gets murdered by a serial killer. Really interesting
        from a storytelling perspective since you're not often expecting the
        protagonist to "lose".
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, just read the quote above again. That's such a sick piece of
        dialogue. The old lady is standing before a serial killer, and she
        trembles with delight at the hope that she's convinced The Misfit to be
        a holy man and spare her life.

        Ok, I would not recommend watching this movie, only because it is
        fucking tragic to watch unfold, but maybe that's on me for watching this
        movie late at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oslo, August 31st is the 2nd movie in Trier's Oslo Trilogy. The 1st
        being Reprised and the 3rd being The Worst Person in the World.
        Interestingly, all feature Anders Danielsen Lie as a lead role across
        the series' 18 years, uniquely capturing him and his characters at
        different points in their life. He doesn't play the same character
        across the series, but his age is often a talking point in each of the
        movies I've seen so far. Lastly, he's an incredible actor with no formal
        training, and his primary profession is as a doctor in Oslo in-between
        movies. Incredible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not trying to compare myself to an Academy-award nominated director,
        but if I was to make a movie, it'd be in the style of Joachim Trier -
        across the two movies I've seen, there's a a very raw portrayal of the
        human experience, depicting flawed protagonists undergoing existential
        problems in their urban lifestyles. Throw in a couple of literary quotes
        into the dialogue as well and that's essentially my style of movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        For context & spoilers, Oslo, August 31st captures the full day of a
        recovering drug addict, Anders, leaving rehab to visit his family and
        friends in Oslo. Throughout this day, you slowly watch Anders life fall
        apart as he struggles to come to terms with the life that awaits him
        outside of rehab, having spent the past 6 years using and dealing
        Heroin. My favorite scene from the movie is 'the cafe scene', where
        Anders sits in a cafe and hears the droning of conversations and life
        around him. I love this scene because it's the best depiction of
        loneliness that I've ever seen in media.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd highly recommend watching the cafe scene on YouTube. I would not
        highly recommend watching the whole movie.

        Final note on my feet, but I think the photo above is so fascinating
        because not only am I standing up again, but you can literally see the
        muscular degeneration in my left thigh based on the wrinkling in my pant
        leg... crazy how you need to use your muscles to keep them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I've recognized lately that I'm not really getting my "writing
        fix" from blogs. Not that I don't enjoy typing up blogs, but they're
        much more journalistic & casual than any genuine attempts at creative
        writing. To some extent, these blogs are stylistically similar to if I
        sent someone a really long text message chain (i.e. I'm not really
        challening myself to write well). That's not to say that my blogs are
        shitposts, but I think my point is understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I've started writing a short story, and it's actually a really
        entertaining endeavor. I'm not oozing ideas every moment I sit down to
        write it, but I do find myself wanting to come back to it, similar to as
        if I were reading an entertaining book. We'll see what comes of it, but
        I went to a writing workshop a couple weeks ago, and it was really cool
        to talk about my story with others who are also interested in writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'm on pace with Min Jin Lee's writing of Pachinko, my book should be
        out by the year 2054. See y'all then!
